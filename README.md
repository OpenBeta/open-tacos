# OpenTacos
OpenTacos is a proof-of-concept/MVP showing it's possible to build a collaborative climbing route catalog.

[Live demo](https://tacos.openbeta.io/areas/105732162/black-velvet-wall) ðŸš€

## Tech stack

1. Data: (see [opentacos-content](https://github.com/OpenBeta/opentacos-content))
- Climbing route data such as name, grade, FA, etc are stored in human-readable text files (markdown syntax)
- Take advantage of folder and file structure to organize crag/area and climb relationship.
- Git-based CMS: Use Git for user management, access control, content review.

2. Frontend: (this repo)
- Gatsby.js, React.js, TailwindCSS
