# OpenTacos
OpenTacos is an proof-of-concept/MVP showing it's possible to build a climbing route catalog from the ground up.

## Tech stack
- Gatsby + React.js
- Climbing route data are kept in human-readable text files (markdown syntax)
- Use folders and files to organize crags/areas and climbs
- Git-based CMS:facilitate user management, access control, submission reviews

Note: For now frontend code and data files live in the same repo.  They will be separated in the future.

## How to build
