# Description
We are going to say this a 5.9- that is and easy find from downtown Elko. Nice Grips and some good foot action to climb. Be careful with the jaggedness of the rock, it can be unforgiving. Head straight up the center of the crack and then veer right to hit the top.# Location
Straight up North 5th st. Make a right turn at the Snowball fork and keep going straight on the road. Once you have made it to the top of the first climb towards the towers make a right turn and you will be right at the edge when the anchors are at.# Protection
Anchors at top with fresh chain. Bring quick draws or carabiners.
