# Description
This route looked much steeper from the parking lot. Upon closer inspection we dropped the rack and soloed it in approach shoes.# Location
When viewing the buttress from the parking lot Trout Slayer is an obvious outward facing corner capped with a small roof. Very central.# Protection
I suppose you could use some nuts and a few cams but it would be runout.
