# Description
Get on this short, ephemeral pillar, if you see it. I climbed it one week and it was a water streak the next.**Does not match any climb in the guidebook. Let me know if there is an earlier ascent or alternate name.# Location
Just off the road above the Sport Wall. Walk off left.# Protection
2-4 short screws and rock gear to make a top anchor
