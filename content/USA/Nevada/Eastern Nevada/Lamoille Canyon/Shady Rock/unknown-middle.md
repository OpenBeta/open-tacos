# Description
A couple cruxes down low on this one. First is getting off the deck with an awkward mantle type move supported by an unimpressive slopey handhold. A couple more moves get you within reach of a very small handhold to propel yourself up to the better ledge 2/3 of the way up. End is easy.# Location
Below the middle set of TR anchors.# Protection
2 bolt TR anchor
