# Description
I THINK this very prominent white dike is where I think it is which would put it to the left of what Todd describes as the 5.7 route "He's Back". Our mileage noted 4.0 miles, whereas Todd noted 3.7.At any rate, this is on wonderful rock and has a very short approach.Pitch #1: Zero in on the obvious white granitic dike intrusion and climb past 10 bolts to a two-bolt belay. 5.10, 35m.Rappel the route.# Location
Somewhat confusing as Todd (the only local I know?) mentions a shorter distance to the pull out below the crag. But his description of "He's Back" seems to be spot on for the the route he climbed to the right of Feather. Really nice, BTW:).Maybe the attached photo will shed some light.On this particular crag, we found only one other route, that being, we think, “He’s Back”.# Protection
10 SS bolts to a two-bolt belay/rappel.
