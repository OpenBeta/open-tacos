# Description
start on the slab on the east side using the thin crack. watch for the loose flake and crumbly feet. then head left of the big ramp. Belay near the bottom of the chimney especially with a 60m rope. We used the tree at the top to belay from the top.# Location

Bring big gear and slings, doubles of 1-4 BD would be nice.
