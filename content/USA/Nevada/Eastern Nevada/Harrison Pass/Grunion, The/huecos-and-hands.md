# Description
Crux at the mungy slab when the huecos become overhanging and the crack disappears. Unbelievable features make most of the climb a ladder.  Sadly, it's very crumbly.  Terrifying topout on lead.# Location
Obvious right hand crack with a ladder of huecos on the left.  South center face of the Grunion.# Protection
Tips to fists.
