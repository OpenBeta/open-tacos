# Description
Start on bomber left hand side pull, right hand on another head high side pull. Left hand to a high notch (could use two fingers or jam all fingers into it for a more solid hold). Right hand higher side pull, left hand to a slot, work the "popcorn" like hold (moonjuice?) near the top and mantle finish. FA was done on a full moon. Very sharp holds and fun techy face moves. There is a right hand pinch or a small right crimp that could be used at the bottom for full value and will likely up the grade a notch or two.# Location
First boulder you see as you park (graffiti on the front and probably some easy warm ups). Moonjuice is on the right facing face of this bolder (if facing the graffiti). Definitely another cool climb or two on this rock for those willing to put in the time!# Protection
