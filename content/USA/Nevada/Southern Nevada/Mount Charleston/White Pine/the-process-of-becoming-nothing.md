# Description
Climb up to the roof and secure the undercling pocket and do a big reach to some hard to see holds just above the second bolt and then make dynamic moves to surmount the small roof. Continued 5.11 climbing leads to the anchors.  One star due to the very low quality rock in the first roof.  Otherwise, a fun line.Beta: Save this one for last.  Consider stickcliping the second bolt. Right hand in the 4 finger undercling pocket.  Don’t grab anything else on the chossy underside of that first roof.  Left hand above the second bolt, semi dynamic move to a good right hand edge in the darker rock.# Location
