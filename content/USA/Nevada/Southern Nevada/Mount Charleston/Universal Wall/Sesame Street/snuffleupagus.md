# Description
Done with Larry DeAngelo, it is easy but run to the first bolt. You want to be sure you are competent at the grade. I've noticed the upper section is getting harder as the nubbins are being worn smooth from traffic. Chains at 75ft.Well, the original poster didn't spell the name right but we all know it's an elephant.I don't remember who did it first, Larry or Tom Beck# Location

Bolts to a chain anchor.
