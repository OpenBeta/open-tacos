# Description
Start over raspberry bushes and a thin moves allows you to clip the first bolt.  Sustained up and right then up and left following the bolts.  Touching the crack to the right makes it easier (at a lower grade) but then you face a difficult transition to move left and over the bulge.  Continue up the friction face to chain anchors.  You can top rope this by scrambling climbers left up some easy 3rd class.  If you do use long slings in setting the anchor to avoid rope drag# Location
Left-most route at Sesame Street# Protection
draws and good line for leader breaking into 5.8+ sport grade as it requires good foot technique and is committing but well protected.
