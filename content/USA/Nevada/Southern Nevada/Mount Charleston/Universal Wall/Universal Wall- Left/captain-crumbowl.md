# Description
I put his route up in summer of ’93 with Jason Astuto, Bart Dinsman, Mark Quinn, Mike Klinger, Gorge Smith et al. Sometime later Thomas Beck added eight more bolts and a belay on the first pitch.Pitch 1, 5.9- Climb a flake with beautiful washboard holds until it ends at about 50’, continue up past a bulge to ledge with an anchor in hollow rock. Go up more washboard holds, passing a small roof on the left and aim for the shallow slot left of the dihedral. Belay on a nice ledge made of stacked blocks with a couple bolts in solid rock but wonky positions.Pitch 2, 5.9- Step right for 10’ and go up steep rock between bulges. At the fourth bolt traverse hard right, staying below the whiter rotten rock, aiming for a short, thin, and dark crack about 80’ away where the cliff bends. Get gear in this crack, go around the corner and up easier rock to a small overhang. Belay above the overhang on a small stance on the left side go the huge cleft in the middle of the wall.Pitch 3, 5.10c/d Climb steep rock straight up to thin ledge below the big roof. Follow the ledge right to where the roof is smaller and not as steep. Use a long runners on the bolts across the ledge or you’ll have big time rope drag. Belay on a nice small ledge above the roof.Pitch 4, 5.8 Climb left and up easy terrain to a dihedral that ends at a big ledge. Continue on the face to the right and up to the huge ledge with the pine trees that runs across the top of the cliff.Descent: Rappel, with two ropes, the last two pitches, then from the top of pitch two, a short rappel straight down to an anchor at the bottom of the large cleft in the middle of the wall. A long rap drops you on a wide section of the long ledge that runs across the bottom of the wall then one more rap to the ground from here.# Location
On the left side of the Universal Wall are two large overhanging sections of white rock with a right-leaning gray swath between. This climb follows this gray swath. Start under a long thin flake about 40' right of an alcove at the base.# Protection
