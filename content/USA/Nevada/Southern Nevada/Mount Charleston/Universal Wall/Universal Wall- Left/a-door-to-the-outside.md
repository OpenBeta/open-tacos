Easy climbing to the high first and second bolts, followed by more engaging moves above, characterized by tucking left at each overhanging section.It's slightly easier than the 5.6 to the left....making it a solid 5.7.# Location
Just right of Swallowtail's Delight, next to a pretty blue patch of rock.# Protection
6 pro bolts.
