# Description
The furthest left line on the tall tower. Varied, interesting,quality climbing through mostly great stone for 12 bolts. An initial flake system on a slab leads to vertical and bulgy jugs, which, after a good rest, charges up through a short shallow corner and a thin bulge. A cool traverse leads to easier ground, and the anchors come shortly after. Great line. 70m required.# Location

12 bolts to anchors.
