# Description
A long, beautiful route. This route has two cruxes, one high and one low, and they couldn't be more different from one another. Sandwiched in between is 70 feet of great 5.10 jugs in ever so slightly overhanging terrain. Your bouldering game will be on display early, while your technical prowess will come to play late: reach out, touch faith.# Location
Second route from the left on the tall tower, Starts in the good yellow rock in the overhang.# Protection
