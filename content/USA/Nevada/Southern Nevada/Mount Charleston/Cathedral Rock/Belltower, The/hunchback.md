# Description
Climbs a solid belt of gray stone up a bushy corner (and avoiding the looseness of the Belltower's arete) for five bolts, and then soars up the bulletproof gray slab above for another 60+ feet. Interesting and varied at the grade.# Location
Starts around the right hand corner from the other Belltower routes.# Protection
12 bolts to anchors.
