# Description
Two early bits of thinness on cool yellow rock culminates in fifty feet of pumpy jug climbing through less than stellar stone. A solid path exists, but the upper portion of this route will likely shed for some time. Even so, the route's climbing is good.# Location
Third route from the left on the tall tower.# Protection
9 bolts to anchors.
