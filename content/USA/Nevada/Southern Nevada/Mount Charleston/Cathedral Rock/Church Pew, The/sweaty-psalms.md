# Description
Go to the end of the chicken line and start climbing well right of the first bolt.  Easy, but thoughtful climbing leads to a ledge.  Get your rest before the ledge, then make "the move" to that jug up and right.  Clip the bolt and run to the chains.I've seen "the move" done at least 4 ways now.  Perhaps the only "warmup" at the crag, as it is the least pumpy or tricky.# Location
Stick clip from the chicken line, and keep your belayer tethered back to the right.# Protection
9 bolts to chains
