# Description
The one armed wonder.Climb technical features straight up to the roof.  Undercling, lieback, and wrassle your way up the feature, finishing with a tough crimpy section, wondering if you'll be the jerk who accidentally breaks off the namesake wafer of rock everyone shakes out on.  Up around the roof, chert ladder gets you home.# Location
Just right of the rap anchor.# Protection
