# Description
An obvious line up a corner.  90 feet of fun.  Mostly good rock.  However, there is some loose rock on the first ledge and just before the last bolt on the mini ledge.  It's not chossy, but the loose rock on these ledges suggests that a helmet is a good idea for the belayer.This route would be easy if I wasn't wearing myFat Jacket# Location
This is the first route you will encounter after turning left off the little falls trail.  It's only about 100 yards off the main trail.  It's not really on the Walden wall but rather about 200 yards prior to Walden.# Protection
