# Description
Bolted from the ground up to establish the other routes.This climb lives up to its name and is the chossiest line on the cliff. Start by moving up the bulge into some adventure climbing. When you get to the permadraw(also to be used as a directional while cleaning), go left and proceed to the better rock up top. You will be rewarded with some nice exposure and views.Heady for the grade.Shares anchors with Lucky '58 and has a skippable last bolt relatively close to the anchors in case climbers intersect at the top of the two routes.This route was bolted solely for the purpose of allowing for the first ascent, and the first ascent information is posted here solely to document the history of the first ascent. No person should read this posting with the assumption that this route or the fixed gear left behind is safe in any way or otherwise appropriate to allow for safe subsequent ascents. Climbing is dangerous and should only be done with the appropriate training and risk management practices that include providing for the climberÂ’'s own safety. Attempting to climb this route as described above or by any other means or methods could result in injury or death.# Location
