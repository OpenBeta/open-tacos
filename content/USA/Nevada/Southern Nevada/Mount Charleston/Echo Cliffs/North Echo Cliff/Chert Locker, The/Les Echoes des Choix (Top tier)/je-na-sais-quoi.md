# Description
Same adventure climbing start as Chossfest 2018, but hang a right at the permadraw and continue up the thin corner to a crux with an interesting exposed move. Bolt after crux is not obvious and is located around to the left of the chert rail bulge.This route was bolted solely for the purpose of allowing for the first ascent, and the first ascent information is posted here solely to document the history of the first ascent. No person should read this posting with the assumption that this route or the fixed gear left behind is safe in any way or otherwise appropriate to allow for safe subsequent ascents. Climbing is dangerous and should only be done with the appropriate training and risk management practices that include providing for the climberÂ’'s own safety. Attempting to climb this route as described above or by any other means or methods could result in injury or death.# Location
Begin on Chossfest and then turn right at the permadraw.# Protection
