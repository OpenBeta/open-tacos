# Description
# Location
Maybe 70 yards before the 2nd bench the trail takes a hard right. Walk straight off the path into some deadfall and pick up a climbers path that goes a long ways climbers left before switchbacking up to the base of the Chert Locker.  Follow the cliff right and up. The beginning of the route has a large, barkless, dead tree standing below it.  The top of the pitch has a tree leaning away from the wall.Alternatively, go to Sonar Wall and make your way left a few hundred yards.# Protection
10 draws and 4 long draws/alpine runners would be a nice setup. Don't get caught up there without a helmet.70m rope to rap.
