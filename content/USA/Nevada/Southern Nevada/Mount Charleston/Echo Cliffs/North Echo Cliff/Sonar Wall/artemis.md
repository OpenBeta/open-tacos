# Description
Early steepness through less than stellar rock leads to some varied and much more interesting climbing. The crux arrives quietly, and while perhaps it isn't trad-ish, it is certainly atypical of a Charleston sport climb. As is common here, the upper few bolts provide the opportunity to climb excellent chert rails to the chains.# Location
