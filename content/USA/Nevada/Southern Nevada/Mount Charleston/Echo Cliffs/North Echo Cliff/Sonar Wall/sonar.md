# Description
A two bolt boulder problem off the ground leads to pumpy, fairly powerful, and sustained climbing. A delicate redpoint crux approaching and surmounting the final roof/bulge guards good chert rails and glory climbing to the anchor.# Location
# Protection
Seven bolts to chains. Stick clipping the first bolt is highly recommended.
