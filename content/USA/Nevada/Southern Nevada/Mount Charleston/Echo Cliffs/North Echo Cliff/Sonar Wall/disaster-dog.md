# Description
A cool opening to a high-ish first bolt leads to chill climbing into a left facing corner. Thin, technical stemming on amazing rock leads to a slight bulge and the crux, with great chert rails easing the difficulty to the chains. Excellent.# Location
# Protection
Six bolts to anchors.
