# Description
A little shorter than its neighbors to the left, but sequency, technical, and pretty difficult from the onset. Each boulder problem on the route gets a little bit harder, and each rest gets worse as you go. The final crux push features thin and brutally sharp chert crimps in slightly overhanging terrain, which quickly retreats to 5.8 glory climbing. Really sweet.# Location

Six bolts to anchors.
