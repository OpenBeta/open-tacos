# Description
Climb the beautiful orange (and sometimes speckled) rock under the widest part of the roof. Interesting and varied climbing brings you to a techy pumpy crux. These moves gain you steep jugs over a bulge, and the route ends on the anchor below the roof.# Location
# Protection
Seven bolts to chains.
