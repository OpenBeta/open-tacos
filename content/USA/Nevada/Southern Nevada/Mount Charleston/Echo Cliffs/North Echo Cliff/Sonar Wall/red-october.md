# Description
An amazing rock climb. An early, thin, cruxy move rewards you with a cool sequence into a no hands rest. What follows is bold, thin, sustained climbing with no rest through three bolts that all have their clipping challenges. Two bolts of slab climbing brings you to the last bolt, and a roof pull guards the chains. Hard for 12c.# Location
# Protection
Nine bolts to anchors.
