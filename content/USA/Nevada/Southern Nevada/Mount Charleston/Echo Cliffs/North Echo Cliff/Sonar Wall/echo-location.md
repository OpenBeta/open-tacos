# Description
This is the second route left of the large right facing corner. Two bolts of easy climbing leads to either a thin and awkward or long and powerful crux. Fight the pump for three bolts and then traverse up and right to bolt number seven. Thin chert climbing keeps you honest past one more bolt to the chains.A little soft at 12a.# Location
# Protection
Eight bolts to chains.
