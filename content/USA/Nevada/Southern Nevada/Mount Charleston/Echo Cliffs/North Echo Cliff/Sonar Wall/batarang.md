# Description
This is a cool new route between Echo Location and Countermeasures that goes straight up the beautiful face just left of the main corner in the middle of the wall.Fun, but tricky sequences are the hallmark of this route.Note- a long draw on the bolt left of the line up high is nice for keep rope drag down.# Location
Start just left of the corner, at a neat looking hole in the rock.# Protection
9 bolts to mussy hooks.
