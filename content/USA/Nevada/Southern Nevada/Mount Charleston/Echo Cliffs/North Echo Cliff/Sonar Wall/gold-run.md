# Description
A burly, beautiful line that ascends the gold wall just right of the big corner in the middle of the wall. It shares a start with Sonar, then movesÂ left into several technical boulder problems with little in the way of rests. A fine addition to the cliff!# Location
Start as for Sonar, but stick clip the orange bolt instead and head up and left onto the golden face, eventually moving back right after you get to the chert to the Sonar anchor.# Protection
7 bolts to a lower off.
