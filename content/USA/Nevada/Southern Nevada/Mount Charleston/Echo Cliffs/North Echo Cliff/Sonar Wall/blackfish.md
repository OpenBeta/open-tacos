# Description
Interesting early climbing past a blade feature and one of the only pockets on the wall leads to bolt three. The very thin and bouldery crux soon follows. Cool and beta intensive climbing continues for three more bolts, until you traverse up and left through two more bolts to Sonar's anchor.# Location
# Protection
Eight bolts to chains.
