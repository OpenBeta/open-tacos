# Description
Climb the obvious right facing corner for four bolts, and then continue straight up and over the capping, blocky overhang. Good holds facing the wrong ways prove to be the crux, but after, the angle eases considerably and the chains await.There is still a working bolt at the crux that should not be clipped while on the send.# Location
# Protection
Eight bolts to chains.
