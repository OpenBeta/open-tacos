# Description
An opening crux boulder problem makes way for a cool sequence on big, blocky jugs to bolt two. Cool, technical chert pulling leads to a bulge with massive chert jugs, which pulls over to jugs on a slab at the last bolt. Interesting, and not super obvious at the grade.# Location
# Protection
Six bolts to chains.
