# Description
Super interesting at the grade! The furthest right route on the wall, a little steepness in a shallow corner takes you to bolt 1. A few more bolts of chert jugs on slab brings you over some blocks (solid to stand on) and into a left facing corner. Cool stemming for a few moves takes you onto the upper slab, and after pulling a slight bulge, a steeper wall with cool chert rails brings you to the anchor. A super pleasant climb!# Location
# Protection
Eight bolts to anchors.
