# Description
Stellar technical crimping up the beautiful blue streak in the left face of Sonar Wall. Post crux, more footwork intensive climbing brings you to a right facing corner covered in rails of chert. Pull through the bulge to the last bolt, and the difficulty eases as you approach the chains.# Location
# Protection
Seven bolts to anchors.
