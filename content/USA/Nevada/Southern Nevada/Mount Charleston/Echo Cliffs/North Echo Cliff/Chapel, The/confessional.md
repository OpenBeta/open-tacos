# Description
Climb the garbage rock to the first bolt, where the nature of the climbing immediately changes, and solid rock and interesting sequences carries you up a slight left facing corner. Pulling a baby overhang gains you an upper slab on chert, and eventually the anchors.# Location
# Protection
Bolts to chains. Stick clipping the first bolt is highly recommended.
