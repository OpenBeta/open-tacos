# Description
The second from the left of the concentration of routes on the right side of the wall.  Starts on a slab and pulls a micro roof (very micro) via a micro left facing corner.  Neither this "roof" nor "corner" are very notable, but they are about the only distinguishing features here to try to direct to the correct route.  A couple good pieces of chert continue up the slab.  Pretty fun.  If escaping the morning sun at Sonar and looking for a warm-up...this is probably the best option as it is less fingery than its neighbors.# Location
