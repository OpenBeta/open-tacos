# Description
A surprisingly crimpy ladder of chert.The start is thin, and could be done from directly below the first bolt, or slid into from slightly right. Â The best holds tend to be feet, and several of the larger looking globs of chert aren't the jugs they appear to be.This thing turned out to be more sustained than it looked from the ground, and turned out to be pretty fun.# Location
Pretty far right on the Sound Garden. 2 routes left of Bonsai that Bush.# Protection
6 bolts to leaver biners.
