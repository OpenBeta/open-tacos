# Description
Start right of the first bolt, using a series of positive features to a positive cutout near the second bolt. A bit of dynamic movement gets you to another cutout above, and even a sinker mono above that near the third bolt.  Maybe don't blow your feet while you're knuckle deep?Good crimp rails right of the bolt get you high enough to step left to B4, and head on up.  After bolt 6 pull around right onto the face, and crimp to the top.  There's a pretty good right hand to clip the anchor off of somewhere up there.# Location
