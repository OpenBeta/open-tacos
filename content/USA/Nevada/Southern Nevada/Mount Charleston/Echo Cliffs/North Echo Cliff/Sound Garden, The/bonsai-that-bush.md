# Description
This route is easily identified by the 2 huecos at the bottom.  Like its neighbor, the bottom of the route is the stiffer bit, while the upper half is pretty cruiser.  Nice holds and pretty good rock throughout.# Location
A small bonsai tree sits above the anchor on this route.  Furthest right route on the wall.# Protection
6 bolts to leaver biners.
