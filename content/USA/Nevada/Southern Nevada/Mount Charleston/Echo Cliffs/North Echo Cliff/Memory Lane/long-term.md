# Description
Techy, safe, and fun.  More than once you'll ask yourself what's going on, right before you figure it out.  Don't blow it before the first bolt.Step off the giant boulder, swinging right around that flat flake on nice chert.  Some big moves, some thin moves, and maybe some tricky stuff too.  This route is characterized by big feet and small hands.  At the very bottom of the 5.11 grade.The whole route trends up and left, which nicely minimizes the amount of choss your belayer should be catching in the face.# Location
Start on the big boulder in the center of the wall.# Protection
A dozen draws.Helmet for the belayer.
