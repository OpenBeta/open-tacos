# Description
RIP Todd.P1 (11d): Climb the easy ramp to the first bolt at 20 feet. Continue up the steepening wall through thin edges to a long and thin crux at the bulge. Pull up and over and fight the pump to the obvious ledge with the anchor. 15 bolts, 160'.P2 (10d): Pull the early crux over the bulge and continue up the vertical wall on amazing chert jugs and crimps, stopping at bolt 11 to take in the view and smile at the incredible position you find yourself in. Two more bolts on bullet gray limestone bring you to the anchor on a big ledge. 13 bolts, 140'.Walk off up and right (15-20 minutes) or rap with two ropes.# Location
The route lies on the left edge of the Memory Lane Area, 70 feet right and slightly uphill of Sonar Wall.# Protection
Bolts and anchors.
