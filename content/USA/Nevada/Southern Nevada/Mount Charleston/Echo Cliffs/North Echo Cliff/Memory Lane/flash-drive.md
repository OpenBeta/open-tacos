# Description
This route sports a single Powerbolt+ in the middle of it.  Presumably Mike Kimm rapped into it, had a look, and decided it wasn't worth it.  Luckily(?) some other idiot with a drill wasn't so discerning.Locate the high first bolt and romp your way up this fun and easy route.  Generous feet make up for any thin crimps that may come along.   Sharp and chossy like the rest of the wall, but that's limestone baby.# Location
Far right on the wall, just before turning the corner.# Protection
Draws.Helmet for the belayer.
