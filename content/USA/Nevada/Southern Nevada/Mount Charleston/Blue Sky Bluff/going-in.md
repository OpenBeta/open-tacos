# Description
The far right corner just right of Bad Seed.Warning!  This route still has some loose rock on it!  I have climbed it a few times without breaking anything, but there is still some dangerous rock on this due to the loose stuff that makes the corner. If one avoids the corner, it seems to be totally bomber rock...but also harder than 5.9.# Location
Far right route, just right of Bad Seed.# Protection
