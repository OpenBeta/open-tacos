# Description
Follow a traversing line of crimps to the obvious traversing line of all natural pockets. The first bolt is just left of the first bolt of Going In.The super fun crux is at the 4th bolt. BIG undercling move off a bomber pocket on bad feet to a rad half pad 2 finger side pull (pocket like feature).I really enjoyed climbing this route!# Location
Far right side of the cliff.  Starts just right of the rad little somewhat hidden cave.  About 30 feet right of Blue Skies and essentially starts on the start of Going In.  (Don't clip the first bolt of Going In).  It is THE obvious line of pockets.# Protection
