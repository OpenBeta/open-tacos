# Description
A seriously cool climb on awesome rock. Every type of hold on this route. Really fun. This is the route with the obvious crack/flake at 2/3's up. Amazingly fun route for 5.8 at Mt. C.If you look up and left from the anchor you will see another set of double bolts from which you can top rope the line between Low Pull and this route. That line was not bolted as it would be a squeeze job.# Location
Second Route from the left on this wall.  About 15 right of Low Pull.# Protection
