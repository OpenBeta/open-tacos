# Description
The first route right of the unbolted scooped/overhanging area.  This route might need more cleaning in the crack/ramp area.  Beware the black death guano.Not a very consistent route. Basically it is 5.10+ climbing to a 3-4 move V6/7? to 5.9 climbing.Crux is an undercling above ramp to a nasty upside down sidepull or gaston to two micro-crimps to a jug above and left of the 5th bolt. Vicious!# Location
Just right of the unbolted overhanging area.  There is a crack/ramp area after the 2nd bolt.# Protection
