# Description
The right line of the 2 routes that share the first 3 bolts.  Climb the 3 first bolts, head right and go past 3 more bolts where you encounter the crux.  Some slightly cryptic moves lead to a jug above...then another easy move to the anchors.  Fun crux moves!# Location
4th from the left route.  The right branching line from the 3 bolts shared with The Flying Oehlers.# Protection
