# Description
The Imaginator is a consistant and fun outing up the center of the Imagination Wall.Begin at the center of the wall near a fairly tall tree.  There are three small, short dihedrals here (maybe 40' tall).  The leftmost one has a black roof/bulge extending from it's top off to the left.  Begin in the rightmost one.P1:  Climb up the dihedral past a few bolts then continue up the face above to a pillar-feature.  Bear-hug up this feature past two or three bolts, then through the roof (crux) and belay at an uncomfortable stance underneath another roof.  130', 5.11c.P2:  Skirt the roof to the left then head up to a very obvious wedge-shaped corner/roof feature.  Pull around this to the left and establish above with some difficulty.  Continue up to a good belay stance.  100', 5.11b.P3:  Climb up off the belay past a bunch of weird iron intrusions.  A difficult blank stretch leads to easier climbing and the top of the wall.  120', 5.11a.Rap the route with a single 70m rope.  Make sure your rope is not a hair shorter than 70m -- you can only get down from the 3rd and 1st pitches with rope strech.# Location
