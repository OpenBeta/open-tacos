# Description
Fun multipitch route with steep, airy climbing. Can be wet in early season. First pitch 10d, second 10c/d, third 10a/b. The end of the second pitch is powerful and contrived, and can easily be climbed around at 5.6 R. The 5.10a/b crux on the 3rd pitch is a bit spicy!# Location
See red line in area photo.# Protection
Lots of bolts (12 or 14 on first pitch I think?), bolted anchors, and an intermediate rap anchor to allow 3 raps with a single 60m rope (watch rope ends!).
