# Description
Two short cruxes bookended by very moderate climbing. First crux is bouldery and sure to spit off those who don't like open handed slopers, and after trying to rest on the very sharp holds, second crux has a difficult clip (long draw reccommended) and a hard move to an ugly chipped pocket. From there on it's hanging on and not pumping off. The highlight of the route is the finishing movement and features; the rock cleans up a lot once the difficulty eases and the top third of this route could be a fun and worthwhile toprope appropriate for people who've just led MJ11b and feel like a little extra milage. The quality of the first crux is high but this is not a destination route for those climbing the grade by any means with the proximity of the Glass House, Imagination Wall, the Roost, and the Hood.# Location
