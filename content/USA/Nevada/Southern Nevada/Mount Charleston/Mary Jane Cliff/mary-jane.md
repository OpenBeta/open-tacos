# Description
This is the best route at this crag. FUN climbing below the roof/bulge up the corner lined with pockets, then a sequential sequence leads you up the small crimps at the bulge to the anchors. This top section seems to spoil a lot of onsight attempts...# Location
This is the obvious third route in from the far right end of the cliff that starts on the pocketed corner.# Protection
