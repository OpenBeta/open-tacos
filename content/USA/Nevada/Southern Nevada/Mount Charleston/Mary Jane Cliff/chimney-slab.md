# Description
An interesting 5.8 with a few awkward moves on razor sharp edges. It'll feel harder than 5.8 if you don't figure out some of the hidden, not so obvious moves right away. IMHO...your average 5.8/5.9 leader may not like it that much.5.10 on up leaders probably wouldn't mind it as a warm up though, especially if their fingers are used to sharp limestone edges.5 bolts to anchors.# Location
Located to the climbers' right of Pine In The Ass, just right of the rotten corner.You can start up the small, rotten chimney/crack, then traverse right to first bolt or just climb straight up the low angle slab.# Protection
