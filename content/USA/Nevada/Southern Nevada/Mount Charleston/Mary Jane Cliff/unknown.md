# Description
Thin and slightly steep technical climbing at the bottom leads to easier technical climbing. Finish at a ledge and the chain anchors. Don't know who first climbed this and happy to give credit where credit is due. Fun crimpy route.# Location
On the left side of the MJ cliff, third route from the far left.# Protection
Four bolts to chains.
