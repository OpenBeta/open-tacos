# Description
this climb has multiple bouldery cruxes with a few alright rests in between. very pump.start on good edges with good feet, throw a big move to a jug, and then negotiate the blank looking face, past a good pocket, before pulling the improbable redpoint crux (hint: thin pocket matched with monos.  cop a rest and then climb the easier grey overhang, placing optional gear before the final bolt and anchors.# Location
this is the second route to the right of the large chimney on the mary jane wall, it is to the left of 'last dance with MJ'. look fr 2 good edges down low, and a 2 finger pocket around the third bolt.# Protection
6 bolts to open shuts. some may opt to sew up the small runout to the last bolt with some small to medium cams
