# Description
Far left route on the cliff-easily accessed by scrambling/walking up to the finishing ledge and anchors. Fun and short, slabbish but positive.# Location
From the point where the trail hits the cliff, walk left 80 feet to a short, slabby wall with bolts.# Protection
Bolts-thoughtfully placed.
