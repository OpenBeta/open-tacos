# Description
I would guess that establishing this route involved a lot of trundling, but the end result is excellent. This is a high quality route with several distinct cruxes: A burly start with poor feet leads to a no-hands rest  (if your leg is the right length), continue up through the low roof and establish above and try to recover before a second crux moving off a pair of vertical slots to an undercling and a few more hard moves. Above this it's just a matter of staying calm during a run from the last bolt up sharp rock to the anchor.# Location
The right-most route at the crag# Protection
9 bolts. Kneepad on the left is nice (I found three knee bars - two of which were hands-free).
