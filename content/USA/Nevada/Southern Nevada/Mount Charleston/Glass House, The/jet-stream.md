# Description
The center line on the crag. Begin from an unnecessary cheater stone and campus up into the crack system. Laybacks and pockets... laybacks and pockets... repeat until reaching a small roof and rest. Easier climbing above the roof leads to an anchor. I employ 5 kneebars with my right leg - pad recommended.# Location
