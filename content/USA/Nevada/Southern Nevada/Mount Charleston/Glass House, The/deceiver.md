# Description
This is a great little pitch that deserves more attention. Powerful liebacking leads to shake. Crux moves to one more shake (just below the old anchor for the route to the left) before an improbable traverse right on a two-finger pocket. Finish up easier climbing on the arete. Surprisingly good climbing and very interesting sequences, but use caution making the third clip.# Location
Follow the handline left from the main section of the wall; Deceiver is the righthand of the two routes.# Protection
8 bolts to lower-off anchor
