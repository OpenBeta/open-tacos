# Description
Fun, steep slab climbing with a lot of jugs and rests. A couple move crux comes later in the route. From the last bolt to chains is heady. This line stays stright up, don't move out right at the midway point, which apparently drops the grade to 11b. Cool movement and fun positioning make this a great route.# Location
2nd route from the left.# Protection
6 bolts, chain anchors.
