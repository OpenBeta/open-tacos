# Description
Starts left of Baby Got Back with first bolt 20 to 30 feet up on a ledge.  However, starting on Baby Got Back to the 4th bolt and then traversing up left to the 2nd bolt of the route seems better.  Climb fairly easy ground to a good rest/jug flake and then launch into some thin side pulls.  Once you gain the downward pointing tooth trend up and left to a chain anchor on a ledge.# Location
