# Description
Start on the slab just left of the Corrision Cave, right of a bush. Head up the slab, which becomes more vertical after the 3rd bolt. Climb towards the obvious crack to the anchors. The rock can be sharp in places. There are some interesting features on the rock before the crack. Two other routes share the first couple bolts, stay left heading towards the crack to the Y. There are a couple extensions above the anchors which run in the 5.12 range.# Location
This is the first route you will come to once walking to the left of corrision cave on the gray slab.# Protection
6 bolts to anchors.
