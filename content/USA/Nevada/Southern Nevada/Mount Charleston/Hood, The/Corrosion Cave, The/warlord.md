# Description
This is basically the first route you see when you arrive at The Hood.  It is a multi cruxed action packed route.  The route starts steep and bouldery for the first half, and then ends with a technical face climbing section, complete with a weird undercling slabby rock over move kinda thing.# Location
This is the leftmost route that starts inside the Corrosion cave.  Clip the first two draws and head right.  Head up at the fourth draw.# Protection
Bolts, and probably fixed draws
