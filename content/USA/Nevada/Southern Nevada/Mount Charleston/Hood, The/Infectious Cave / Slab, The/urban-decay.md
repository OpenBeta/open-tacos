# Description
This is a great route and a bit different than some of the other steep routes at Charleston in that it is crimpier than others, and doesn't seem to have as many pockets.  Start up easy ramp and then head up through steep pumpy enduro climbing.# Location
This is the rightmost route located in the Infectious cave.  At last bolt, head right to anchors.# Protection
bolts, probably with fixed draws
