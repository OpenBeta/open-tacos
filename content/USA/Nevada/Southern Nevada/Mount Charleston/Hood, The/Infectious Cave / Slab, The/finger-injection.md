# Description
Popular, fun warmup for the harder stuff that remains interesting and unique, though it can feel pretty greasy near the crux.# Location
Just right of a grey corner; starts up a pretty, colorful slab to a small mini-ledge you can stand on to clip the second bolt. Pulls a bulge and slabs out to finish.# Protection
Bolts.
