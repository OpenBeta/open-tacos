# Description
A beautiful line with amazing, flowing movement and anchors that are guarded by a cryptic and extremely hard boulder problem. This one is well worth getting on- if you're hanging your draws, bring two long slings- one for the anchor and one for the last pro bolt, both are hard to clip.Start up right of Rappin Boys off a small ledge aiming for the beautiful orange corner above. Jazzmatazz goes straight up (there's a 5.12+ variation that goes left after a few bolts), traversing left, then back right into the obvious upper corner. A burly crux guards the anchor (be prepared to whip a few times figuring it out).If you're looking for an even tougher challenge, this route holds a super long extension that clocks in at 5.13b and goes almost to the top of the cliff.# Location
South Central, the right hand route on the small ledge system mid-cliff.# Protection
7 bolts + anchor (more for the extension)
