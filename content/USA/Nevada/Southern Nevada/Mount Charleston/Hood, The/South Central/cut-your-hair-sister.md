# Description
Clip bolts up a thin, water grooved slab of nice blue limestone. The crux comes when the texture changes to smooth white patina just before the mantel to the anchor ledge.# Location
Just right of the Pine Tree ledge and left of Rappin Boyz.# Protection
5? bolts or so. You can count from the ground.
