# Description
Bloodline is the first route ever to be climbed at The Hood. Begin on the cheater stones and power your way through the low crux on bad feet and tricky holds to a good vertical slot. Move up through the pod and make your way right through good pockets and fun movement.# Location
This is the second route to the left of the Souls Cave and is landmarked by cheater stones at the base.# Protection
