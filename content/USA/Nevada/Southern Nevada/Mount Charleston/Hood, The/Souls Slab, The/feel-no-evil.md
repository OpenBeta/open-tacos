# Description
Delicate slab leads to a ledge, then traverse up and right into a shallow dihedral. A stemmy transition (crux) brings you onto a granitesque flake that takes you to the chains.There is an extension which is very good (4 more bolts to chains)... (5.11b)! It's very technical, delicate climbing off of sidepulls and shallow pockets.# Location
Start 10 feet up and left of the "toe" of the slab and just right of a bush growing out of the rock. Can be confusing because many routes start around this area... if you make it your goal to get to the flake, it's all 5.10 and all fun.# Protection
bolts. If someone doesn't take them (please don't take them) there are "courtesy" caribiners at the anchors to lower off of. (it saves the hardware!)
