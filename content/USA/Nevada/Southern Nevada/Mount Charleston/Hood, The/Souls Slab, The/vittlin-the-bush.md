# Description
Can easily be mistaken for Just Another Warm Up, avoid doing so if you can. Short, awkward, and fingery. Not very enjoyable compared to other 5.11's in The Hood.# Location
The first route to the left of Compton Cave.# Protection
Bolts to shared anchors with Just Another Warm Up and Hear No Evil.
