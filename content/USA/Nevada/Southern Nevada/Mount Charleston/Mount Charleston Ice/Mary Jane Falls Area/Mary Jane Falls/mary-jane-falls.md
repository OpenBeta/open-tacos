# Description
Steep and sustained ice climbing the whole way. Ice might be a little chandalery in spots. Mushroom forms at base when touching. Sometimes free hanging dagger. Route gets lots of sun so usually best to get an early start on this one.# Location
# Protection
All screws. 16cm and up if you have them. Couldn't find any anchors up top. Maybe I just missed them.
