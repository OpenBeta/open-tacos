# Description
This fun jaunt climbs up a series of short (20-40 foot) ice ramps that follow an interesting gully up the mountainside.  This little route is a very enjoyable climb.Approach:Park at the Cathedral Rock Trailhead.  There is an outhouse here and a series of stairs.  Often in the winter these stairs are closed in order to avoid accidental falls.  Climb up the stairs (or the hillside) to the trailhead at the top.  Follow the trail to the right for .4 miles to the base of the falls.  Be sure to gear up below the first logjam.  The approach time is about 15 minutes.Route:Ascend the first ramp, climbing over any logs that might still hang above the ice.  You will find yourself in a large bowl with graffiti on the walls.  Ascend the next ramp into another bowl.  Here you will discover bolted belay stations on either side.  Climb up easy ice for approximately sixty yards to the base of another short step.  Continue up the ravine for sixty or so feet to the base of yet another ramp.  this is usually the most fun part of the route.  Climb the thin strip of ice to the top.  Ascend the gully for about sixty feet to the base of another thin ramp.  Climb this last ramp to top out.Descent:Rappel the route.  Bring extra sling or cordellete material to leave behind.# Location
