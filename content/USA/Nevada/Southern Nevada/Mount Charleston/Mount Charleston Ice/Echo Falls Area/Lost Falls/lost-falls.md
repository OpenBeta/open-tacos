# Description
These falls may be lost for a reason!  This route is a mere thirty feet long.  However, it is an excellent place for beginners to try and swing their tools for the first time.Approach:Follow the South Loop Trail for approximately two miles.  Not long after passing the Las Vegas Hose Monster drainage, the trial will begin to wind uphill towards an obvious gap between the rocky peaks.  A large cliff will appear on the left.  Ascend this steep drainage to the base of the falls.  This approach takes between one and two hours depending on snow conditions.Route:Climb the obvious route.  One may be able to scramble up to the left in order to set up a top-rope.Descent:Rappel the route using a tree or scramble down climber's left.# Location
