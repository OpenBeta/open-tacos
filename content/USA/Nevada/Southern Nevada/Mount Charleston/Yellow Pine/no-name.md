# Description
The first crux comes off the deck pulling on some good edges and making a big reach over a small roof to jugs.  The last crux is pulling the roof after the last bolt to gain the chains.# Location
This is now the 3rd route from the left.  It is located just right of the steeper 11- route.  It is characterized by red hangers.  Needs some traffic as it has only two ascents as of 8/4/09.# Protection
6 bolts and chains
