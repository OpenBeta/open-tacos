# Description
A tad bit sharp...Shares common start with Stay Foolish.  Starts 15 feet right of Yellow Pine and 10 feel left of "Unknown 2" (the far right 11A).  Follow the 2 shared bolts with Stay Foolish, clip the upward traversing bolt and head left toward the arete/corner (you can climb either the arete while liebacking the corner/crack or stemming in the corner) and up for 2 more bolts to the anchor.I considered a straight up start through the blocky start, but this seemed like the more natural (and certainly the easier) line. It's easy to TR the direct start which is fun but quite hard and kind of loose as you come out of the starting corner and onto the face.# Location
