Access route to upper ledge on right side of cliff. Not a route to climb for fun. Often skipped for a scramble up a log and then a crack system to the right, which is harder than it looks. Safest route to the upper ledge.# Location
In an obvious area of tree/log collapse on the right, upper section of cliff.# Protection
