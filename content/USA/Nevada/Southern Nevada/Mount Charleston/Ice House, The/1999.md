Good climbing with some steeper-than-it-looks moves. Good pump, broken holds at crux have moved grade up in several people's opinions to 11d/12a.# Location
Scramble up to a ledge to begin about 50 feet right of Baby Face, just right of a large hole (someone was living in this thing for a while-it's pretty spacious).# Protection
9 bolts.
