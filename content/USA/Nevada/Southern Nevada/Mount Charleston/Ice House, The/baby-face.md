# Description
Short, crimpy and fun. A little sharp, but it's a worthwhile tick while you're on this side of the crag.# Location
Short route up the bulging, wavelike wall close to the edge of the cliff. Short walk over from the "Nothing is Easy" short route to access the upper ledge, where the fallen trees are piled at the base of the wall.# Protection
3 bolts.
