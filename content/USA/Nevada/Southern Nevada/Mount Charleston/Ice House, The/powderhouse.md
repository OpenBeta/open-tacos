# Description
Fun route up a beautiful powder blue corner. Good footwork and crack climbing experience count for a lot on the smooth, powdery, diamond-hard limestone jams. Fun face climbing as you exit the corner and head for the chains.# Location
Just uphill from Satellite. The corner screams to be climbed, kind of hard to miss.# Protection
6 Bolts.
