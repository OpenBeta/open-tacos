# Description
Another classic of the crag, this route ascends the obvious, pocketed blue streak above an obvious ledge system about 150' right of Powderhouse.Start on a large cheaterstone to reach the first hold, rock over and crank through the relatively easy terrain that leads to the ledge at 35' or so. Once on the ledge, scope out the pockets above and prepare for battle- getting to the corner crack above will test your pocket skills at the grade.Once in the corner, the crux is behind you, but dont let your guard down- its not exactly a walk to the chains.PLEASE LEAVE THE DOUBLE CARABINERS ON THIS ANCHOR (or replace them with quicklinks and carabiners- single carabiners will twist your rope!).# Location
Downhill from Powderhouse, look for the obvious blue streak up high that leads to a left facing corner crack. This is the route- it starts at an obvious weakness in the wall below with 4 bolts leading to the ledge below the streak. Cheater stones are in place below the first bolt as of Summer 2013.# Protection
12 bolts to an anchor.
