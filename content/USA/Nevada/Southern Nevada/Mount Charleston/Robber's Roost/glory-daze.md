# Description
This route shares the first four bolts of Connie Loves Daddy (not counting the bolt to get you to the ledge).  Once at the fourth bolt where the climbs diverge, head left past two more bolts to a crux with a long move, with big air as the penalty for failure.  From here the route traverses left and up for three more bolts on sustained, pumpy climbing with a few rests scattered about.  At the last two bolts head up and find the rest at the last bolt.  You will want to get as much back as you can, because the redpoint crux comes at the chains, again with big air for the unsuccessful.The bolts on this route are a bit spaced out, and many of the falls are pretty big.  However, the wall is gently overhanging and there is nothing to hit but air.# Location
This route is on the right side of the main wall.  It shares the start with Connie Loves Daddy.# Protection
12 bolts, 1 bolt to get you to the ledge where the climbing really starts and 11 through the business.Chains at anchors.
