# Description
Climb The Great Train Robbery or Joe Dirt to a slab then continue up gently overhanging wall all the way to the top. Epic climbing on some of the best rock at the Roost. Often-overlooked sadly.Even with an 80 you'll need to rethread on one of the lower anchors.# Location
Top left of the robbery wall. Tallest route on the wall goes all the way up to the base of a tree# Protection
Bolts and fixed chains
