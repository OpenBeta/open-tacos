# Description
This climb is the extension to Los Banditos.  Climb to the anchor of Los Banditos, take a long rest and then launch into the climbing above.  Joe Dirt starts with a big move right away, followed by sustained crimping on mostly positive holds.  There are lots of rests along the way, so find them and milk them, as the crux comes at the second to last bolt.  This crux requires the use of a mono pocket for most, so be aware if you have an aversion to using them.  I usually avoid routes that have monos, but this one is not too bad.  The crux also has a lot of moves and penalizes failure with a lot of air time.# Location
This route is the extension to Los Banditos.# Protection
Los Banditos needs 9 draws, a sling for the last bolt is advisable.  From here it is 6 more perma draws.
