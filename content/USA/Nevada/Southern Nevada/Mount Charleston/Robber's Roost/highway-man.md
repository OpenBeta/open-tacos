# Description
A great route that is a little pumpy but doesn't throw any hard moves at you.  The 12a rating comes from sustained 11 climbing.# Location
At the end of the trail, climb the middle line of bolts from the ledge on the north side.  It is the right-most line with fixed draws.# Protection
Fixed draws with lower-off anchor.  No runouts.
