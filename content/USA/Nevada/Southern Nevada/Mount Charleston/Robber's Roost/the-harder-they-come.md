# Description
Described in the "Islands in the sky" guidebook as "gear to tree", this route sports nothing but bolts.  Perhaps it was retro-bolted?  Either way, it's a good route that follows a crack for the entire way.  It'd be a semi-heads up lead on gear, and even with the bolts it keeps you honest.  Good route, great warm up - Jimmy Cliff would approve.# Location
