# Description
A shorter but more aggressive and bouldery route compared to a lot of the mid 5.12 routes in the Roost. The route starts in a blackened dihedral with balancey moves that lead to a corner at the 2nd bolt then moves into a powerful boulder sequence on a steep overhang and finishes on the steep arete. An often overlooked route but well worth the time.# Location
Start holds are at the base of the blackened dihedral towards the back alleyway of Robbers Roost.It is to the right of 'The Rooster' (5.10c).# Protection
5 bolts (the two bolts on the steep face have permadraws that make cleaning the route a lot safer and easier), cold shut anchors.
