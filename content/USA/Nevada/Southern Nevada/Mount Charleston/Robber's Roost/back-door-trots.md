# Description
Excellent well protected slab route.  Starts off easy for the first few bolts.  Soon you will be able to gain the slab face.  Tip toe up the slab until you reach the crux near the anchors.  Slightly harder than the route to it's left.  This route has existed for quite some time, but has never made it on Mountain Project.  I would love to give credit to those who set this route as it is excellent in quality.# Location
Take the trail to Robbers Roost taking a left at the first main trail that cuts up the hill.  When you hit the base of the wall, walk left down the wall passing the small cave.  This is the second route from the far left of the wall.# Protection
9 Bolts + chains.  The chains have carabiners, please leave them.
