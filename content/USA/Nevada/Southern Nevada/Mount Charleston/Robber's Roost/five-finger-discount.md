# Description
This route is much different than its neighbors to the right. Move up a left leaning crack on interesting holds to the 3rd bolt. Make a tricky reach to a base of a pod. Clip the 4th bolt and make your way up and past the pod on slippery feet. The climbing eases greatly and trends left to an anchor.# Location
The right of two routes on the grey wall to the left of Great Train Robbery and Los Banditos. Start on a ledge about 15 feet up.# Protection
