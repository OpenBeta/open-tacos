# Description
This route is a lot more fun to climb than it first appears.  Start out by scrambling up easy blocky terrain to reach the first bolt.  From here a bit of moderate climbing leads to the crux which starts at the 3rd bolt and ends just after the 4th bolt.  Once past the crux, moderate, slightly pumpy, inobvious climbing leads you to the anchor.The fourth bolt can be a bit of a bear to clip.# Location
