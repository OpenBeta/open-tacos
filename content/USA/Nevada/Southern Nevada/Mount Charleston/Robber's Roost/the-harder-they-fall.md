# Description
Hey 'mon, you like some limestone slab climbin'?  'Den hop on 'dis route and get irie.  No polish, and it got 'dem good crisp edges.Jimmy Cliff and Reggae references aside...this is a good route if you like thin, techy stuff.  It feels like it was bolted on lead, and feels a touch heads up, specifically around the roof feature.  The climbing here is positive, if you find the right sequence, but a fall could be...how you say...no bueno.  The top is no gimme either, but at least you won't hit anything.# Location
