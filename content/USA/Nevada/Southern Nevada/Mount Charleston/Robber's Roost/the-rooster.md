# Description
This is a great route that climbs the prominent blue water groove on the left wall. It's not the typical sport route. This one requires stemming the entire pitch which is long one. Keep a cool head as it would not be good to fall( This route is known as Rooster aka razor blade alley).# Location
Left wall  opposite of the Robbery wall. Can't miss it, look for the blue water groove.# Protection
12 bolts to L.O.
