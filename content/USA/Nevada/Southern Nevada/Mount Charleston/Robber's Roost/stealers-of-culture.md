# Description
I can't believe that this route doesn't get any traffic.  It is every bit as good as Connie and Highway, but just a letter grade harder.  Interesting moves, mostly positive holds and a high pump factor makes this route a great outing.  The only thing that keeps this route from being a four star classic is the approach climbing (5.2ish) and the awkward 4th clip on the second pitch (5.12b).  This climb is well bolted..so go get after it.To access this climb, go up the shared start to Connie and Highwayman and once on the ledge, head right until you get to a bush and a two bolt anchor.  Unless you want to bring your belayer up to this anchor, lead to here on one rope (drop it when anchored in), and lead on another rope for the actual route OR lead up to the anchor, pull your rope through and go from there.  Either way your belayer gets to stay on the ground.# Location
This route is two routes to the left of Highwayman.# Protection
1st pitch 5 bolts to anchors. 2nd pitch 8 bolts to anchors.
