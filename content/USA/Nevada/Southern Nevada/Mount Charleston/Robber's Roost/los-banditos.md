# Description
This is a great, fun route with interesting, balancey moves. It starts up easy rock near the start of the Great Train Robbery and heads right up the easy, juggy ramp onto the ledge (full body rest, although you don't really need it yet), then left through some jugs (and a no-hands rest via a stem) to a crux section through some small holds to the biggest jugs ever, which lead to the anchor.# Location
Immediately right of the Great Train Robbery at the obvious, juggy, right-leaning ramp.# Protection
9 bolts to lower-off.
