# Description
This is the easiest of the extensions on the routes at the Roost, and one of the most fun that I've done. Bring a 70m and expect to use the entire thing! Hang tough through a couple cruxes (good holds appear quickly above each of them)  and the chains are yours.When lowering off, it's a good idea to unclip all but the first chain draw to straighten the rope and give you a few extra feet of slack to get down. It can be a very close lower with a 70m if your 70m is older or cut at exactly 70m.# Location
Left hand extension at the top of Train Robbery.# Protection
This is the left hand extension at the top of the Train Robbery. Start up Robbery (it's a good idea to use some long slings and back clean a couple draws to keep drag down), then bust left after the first anchor and follow chain draws to the anchors high above.
