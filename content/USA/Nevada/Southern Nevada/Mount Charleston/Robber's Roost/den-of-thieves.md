# Description
If you want short and punchy, this is your route. Looked more inspiring from the ground. Hard moves accented with some hurtful pockets, topped off with a donâ€™t-get-stung-in-the-tail slab finish.# Location
Way left side of the wall, starts left of the cave with what looks like a fun sequence of pockets.# Protection
3 bolts to Metolius rap bolts
