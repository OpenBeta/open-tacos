# Description
One of the better 5.12a's up at Charleston, this fine route starts on a ledge up and left from the cave that holds America's Most Wanted and Arrested Development. Thug your way up an obvious flake system, traversing rightward (going straight up is Glory Days/Crack) after the 3rd/4th bolts off the ledge. Catch a shake when you can and hang on through the finish.# Location
Start down and right from the Train Robbery area at a tree sheltered area. Climb up the 4th class, clip a bolt, then head for the ledge. Conny is the first route you come to, just left of Highway Man.# Protection
7 bolts, chain anchor with mussy/steel carabiner
