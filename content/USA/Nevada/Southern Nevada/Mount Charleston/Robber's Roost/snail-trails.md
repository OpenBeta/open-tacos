# Description
Start on A fun bit of short steep climbing, then figure out how to pull the lip. A classic technical slab with awesome pinches and under clings leads to a great rest on a flake. Pull off the flake onto continuous long moves on good holds to an the big under cling then a tecky finish on perfect blue stone. Make sure you have a 70 meter rope or you'll be rethreading at some point.# Location
