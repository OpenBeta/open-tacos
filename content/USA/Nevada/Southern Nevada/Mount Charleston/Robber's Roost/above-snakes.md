# Description
Excellent well protected slab route.  I believe this is one of the easiest routes on this wall and perfect for a new leader.  Head up the easy crack and shoot out left to an awesome flake.  Tread up the easy slab to the anchors.  This route has existed for quite some time, but has never made it on Mountain Project.  I would love to give credit to those who set this route as it is excellent in quality.# Location
Take the trail to Robbers Roost taking a left at the first main trail that cuts up the hill.  When you hit the base of the wall, walk left down the wall passing the small cave.  This is the route farthest to the left.# Protection
9 Bolts + chains.  The chains have carabiners, please leave them.
