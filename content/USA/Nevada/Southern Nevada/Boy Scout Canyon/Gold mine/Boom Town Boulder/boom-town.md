# Description
Start left in the finger trap (small sharp pocket) I can fit luckily two fingers but some may have to mono. Right low slanting jug hold. Make athletic moves to decent rail then power up for a huge drive by to triangle pinch. So good. Hold the tension and finish out for the weak/strong top out.Â There is a possibility for a lower harder start but I thought it to be awkward because of positioning.# Location
