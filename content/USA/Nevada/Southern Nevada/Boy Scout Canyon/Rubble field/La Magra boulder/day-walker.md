# Description
This thing is physical. Sit start both hands in a hidden hueco. Move to a small but positive crimp then first big move to a shark tooth out right then the crux move. A low percentage dead point. I found this to be a succession of right hand bumps. UseÂ tension to move to the jug. Move left to mantle out.# Location
Right side of the boulder. Actually the first problem you see when getting to the boulder.# Protection
Two pads is sufficient a spotter would be nice
