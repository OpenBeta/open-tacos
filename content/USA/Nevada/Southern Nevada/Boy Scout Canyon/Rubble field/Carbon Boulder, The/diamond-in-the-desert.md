# Description
Start on two great edges about chest high. Use holds around the arete and on the face to make it to the top! Side pulls near the top on the face I thought were crucial.  Great setting and exposure. The landing if one fell would not end up well it’s rocky and steep. I fell at the very bottom trying to put a sit start to it and a hold blew and I tumbled down the rocks. Abandoned the a sit start and started with the obvious.# Location
Near the top of the rubble field a few minutes past the La Magra boulder.# Protection
Two pads a spotter necessary. More pads may be nice.
