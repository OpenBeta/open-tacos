# Description
An easy fun climb where the crux is leaving the ground. Starts right at the toe of the buttress with a boulder problem, or just onto the north side to keep it fourth class, then straight up the blunt ridge. Bring 15-20’ of sling to set up a rappel on one of the many features on top or down climb to descend.# Location
East side of the tower.# Protection
A selection of cams up to 4” and a nut tool for cleaning if using a rope.
