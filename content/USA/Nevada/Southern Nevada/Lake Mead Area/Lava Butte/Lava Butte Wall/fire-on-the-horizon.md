# Description
Begin with the broken dihedral/arete through a slight overhang where the arete becomes more uniform. Step slightly right and pull the roof though the obvious finger crack. This is the crux and it can be done using the crack and/or face holds at the same grade. The crack ends a few feet above the roof. Clip a bolt and step left to easy moves or fire the face with another 5.9 move to a ledge. Face climb past a few horizontals and small seams to the belay bolts at the top. Rappel the right side of the column (a 60m rope will get you within few easy 5th class feet of the ground).# Location
The thin crack on the face of the big column in the center of the wall.# Protection
Single set of cams to 3", set of stoppers, one bolt.
