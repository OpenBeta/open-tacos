# Description
Start on excellent rock with a few largish vesicles down low. Following good rock, continue up aiming for the left side of a fin of rock that juts out up high. The edge of the rib is a bit loose but the seams a few feet on the left face are good for pro. Belay by a good ledge and lasso the top of the ridge for a belay, all of the rock here is too loose for reliable gear or bolts. To descend, hike down the hill a short ways to rappel from the anchor of Fire on the Horizon (a 60m rope will get you within few easy 5th class feet of the ground).# Location
To the right of the main wall where the wall is more broken and lees steep.# Protection
Single set of cams to 2", set of stoppers.
