# Description
Begin with the broken dihedral/arete through a slight overhang where the arete becomes more uniform. At the slight headwall step right, past the finger crack of Fire on the Horizon, to a seam that wraps around the side of the column just a few feet left of the chimney. Where the seam ends climb the wider cracks left of a stack of large boulders. Belay on top of the boulders or stop at the ledge with bolts 10â€™ from the top. Rappel from the bolts of Fire on the Horizon (a 60m rope will get you within few easy 5th class feet of the ground).# Location
In the center of the wall on the big column, wrapping around the right side.# Protection
Single set of cams to 3", set of stoppers.
