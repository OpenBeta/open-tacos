# Description
There is a flake about halfway up on the left that sounds hollow but turned out to be pretty solid.  Four of us used it and it is in a key location of the climb.  Does not look like the top is accessible to TR.# Location
This is the leftmost of the 5 routes on this face.  The chains are easily seen at the top.  The pictures help with the lack of a good description.# Protection
The 5 bolts are well spaced and the two anchors have chains that come down to a large single steel non-locking biner.
