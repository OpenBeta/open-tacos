# Description
P1. From the east side follow an angling third class sidewalk-like ramp along the south side of the tower. Near the end of the ramp it turns steep with a 5.0 move to step up onto a small ledge and set a belay with gear. The ledge is out of the fall zone for the next pitch. It’s also an easy pitch to solo.P2. Expect some rock fall. Step right and down to get back to the crack that leads to the notch where summit splits- the last spot for good pro. From the notch go up the last 20’ on the loose steps on the left. Sling the top of the tower for a belay. Bring about 30’ of sling to set a rappel for descent.# Location
From the base on the east side of the tower scramble around to the south side on steep ramps.# Protection
Cams up to 5”. Extra sling to rappel.
