# Description
The first known attempt at this climb ended in two broken legs. Climb the waterfall in the wash via bouldering or top rope. Use boulders and/or obscure gear that are a short ways back from edge to set a top rope. The rock outside of the scrubbed clean zone is rotten. This is the rightmost route at the crag.# Location
In the wash at the first cliff band.# Protection
Ropes and slings to set an anchor and reach the top of the climb.
