# Description
An absolutely fascinating wavy-gray arete finishes off this long and lovely climb. Â Use edges and angles to work up to a slight roof, easier than it looks. Great big holds scoot you around leftward, to the base of the arete, where edges peter out and you'll need to get creative. Fantastic friction on scoops and sidepulls gets you to the top.# Location
In the section of wall left of the guano hole, this one starts just left of the hole and continues up the outer edge of the gray arete# Protection
