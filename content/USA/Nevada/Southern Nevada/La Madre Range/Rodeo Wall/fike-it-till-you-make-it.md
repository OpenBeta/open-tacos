# Description
Super fun variety of movement and rock texture. Face climb on edges and angles, making a slight rightward traverse around bolt 4-5 or so. Pull some jugs to get to the distinctive yellow right-facing corner. Â Layback your way up the corner crack on excellent textured feet. That crack runs out at the last bolt before the anchor ... what do??# Location
In the section of wall left of the guano hole, this one starts just left of the medium roof and finishes high in the yellow right-facing corner# Protection
11 bolts to anchor with rusty chains
