# Description
One of those routes that's better than it looks, with a devious mid-route crux ("Where are the good holds?" "There aren't any, just keep going!") and a super fun blocky roof pull to ice the cake. Â High first bolt on easy terrain.# Location
In the section of the wall to the right of the guano hole, this one climbs to a ledge, then over a roof to an anchor in a blotchy orange patch of rock. The anchors to Authentic Texas BBQ (12b) are left of the large, distinctive crescent flake, the anchors to this route are right of the flake.# Protection
6 bolts to anchor with rap rings
