# Description
Steep start for 1 bolt, then fun and cruiser.  Another route that is surprisingly easy on the hands.  A good candidate for cold weather, or your first route of the day, before the bees at the top wake up.# Location
Left of the long route with the blue slab at the top (Direct TV)# Protection
8 bolts and a chain anchor.
