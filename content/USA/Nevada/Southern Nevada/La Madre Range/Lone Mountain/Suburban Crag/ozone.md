# Description
P1: follows the chert up on balancy moves using somewhat delicate crimps. Very runout, probably 25' to first bolt on ~5.9 climbing (usually runouts at this crag are on very easy ground but this was sketchy). Single best pitch under 5.11 at Suburban Crag. Erik's Arete is a close second.P2: after chert ends, gains a large ledge and then goes up a slightly overhung wall using a series of horizontal cracks and textured smears. Allegedly 5.9, but felt like stout 5.10- to me... you be the judge!P3 (optional): one 5.8 move off the P2 anchors, but no bolts until the chains... P3 allows for summit top out and better rap position.Two 35m raps to the ground.# Location
P1 (5.10c): just to the left ofBlu-Ray (the non-direct variation), it's the first route right if the cave. Anchors are easier to see if you step back from the wall about 15', they're just below and left of a pink cactus.7 BOLTSP2 (5.10a/b): goes up and right from chains.7 BOLTS(Optional) P3 (5.easy): 25' up and left to another set of chain anchors.Rock quality up and right of P2 chains is suspect.0 BOLTS# Protection
7 bolts per pitch and chain anchors at the end of each
