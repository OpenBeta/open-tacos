# Description
Start on the right side of the cave. Run it out to the first bolt, pull up and start heading leftward. Fairly moderate and fun climbing leads to a brief steep section near the top of the cave.  I suggest staying right and clipping the bolt from the side.  Above, more easy terrain leads to a final head wall and the crux both physically and mentally.If you got rained off your trad climb, you might enjoy this rig.# Location
Just right of the tallest cave.# Protection
13 bolts to mussys.  Could be lowered into the cave if climbing on a shorter rope.
