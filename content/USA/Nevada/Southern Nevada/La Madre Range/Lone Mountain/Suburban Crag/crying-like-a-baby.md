# Description
Shares the first pitch with In Your Eye, and takes the right variation above the anchor.   Big holds, good feet, and comfortable rock.  This thing looks improbable and yet flows really well.  The big features give it a trad feel.Take off from the anchor on big feet and balancey side pulls and make your way up toward the roof.   Crux is deciphering which holds to use to clip the bolt below the roof.  After that, each 5.10 move rewards you with a rest to keep the grade down.  Send and enjoy.# Location
Locate the shared anchor with the other multipitch, a double ring anchor above a large rock nettle.# Protection
8 bolts to chains on the second pitch
