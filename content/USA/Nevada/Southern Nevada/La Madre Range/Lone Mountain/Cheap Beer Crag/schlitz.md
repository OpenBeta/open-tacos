# Description
Another sharp 10 which parallels original route 1, but a few feet to the right, tackling the small roof head-on then passing the route 1 anchors on the right to continue up another 20 feet of moderate climbing. Watch out for a couple loose-looking blocks up here, easy to avoid though.Called 10d in the new Mojave limestone guide but felt somewhat easier (certainly easier than King of Beers in my mind), more like 10b. Also called Schlitz in that guide, but as there is already another route by that name in mp I'll avoid the naming confusion for now and let someone else solve that problem.# Location
Just left of the small cave, parallels original route 1 but heads straight over the small roof with the white spot.# Protection
