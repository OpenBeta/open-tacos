# Description
Rightmost route that finishes on the small roof that tops the center of the crag. Up past a large loose-looking flake on its left side to some lower-angle terrain before a reach over the lip to gain the top. Somewhat runout compared to its neighbors, but soft for the grade. If this is the best Milwaukee has to offer, I don't ever want to go to Milwaukee...# Location
Last set of anchors on the right side of the roof that tops the wall.# Protection
5 bolts to drop-ins
