# Description
Climb up small crimps to the first bolt (good clipping crimp just next to it) and bust up and left to some side-pulls. Make a big move to a pointed jug in a large crack. Follow the good holds up to the last bolt. Climb left around the bulge and to the large jug/crack below the shuts, in want for feet.# Location
This is the sport line immediately to the right of Navajo.# Protection
4 bolts to drop-in anchors.
