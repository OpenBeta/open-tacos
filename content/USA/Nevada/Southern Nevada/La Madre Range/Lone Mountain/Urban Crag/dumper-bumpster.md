# Description
This was my favorite route at the crag.  It has some length and variety.  Start out in a section of opposing corners with some stemming, climb left along an intermittent crack for a while, then pull a bulge on sharp holds to head for the anchors.Islands in the Sky rates this 5.10, the older Brock Vegas Limestone book rated it 5.10a, but I felt it was easier than any of the other 5.10 routes at the crag.Please don't TR directly through the open cold shuts, use your own equipment so they don't wear out and are safe for the next party.# Location
It can be found on the right side of the alcove, just right of a pair of 5.11d climbs.# Protection
6 bolts to open cold shuts.
