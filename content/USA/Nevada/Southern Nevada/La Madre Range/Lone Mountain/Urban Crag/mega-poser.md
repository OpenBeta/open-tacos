# Description
This short, yet powerful route is quite good for its meager height.  For those who think that Vegas has soft ratings for its climbs, this route will challenge that notion.  Not sure if I felt this route has a definitive crux as there is hard climbing starting at the first bolt and goes to just past the fifth bolt.  Some of the clips are tenuous so be careful.  There is a small runout to the anchors, but if you have made it that far, you won't fall off the easy climbing.# Location
There are three routes on the left side of the wall at a small alcove, this is the middle route.# Protection
5 bolts to lower off
