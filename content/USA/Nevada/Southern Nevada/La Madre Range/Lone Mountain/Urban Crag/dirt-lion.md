# Description
Dirt Lion is in the back of the cave and starts at the letter "M." Bouldery, deadpoint style moves using decent holds gain a large ledge. After that endurance 5.11- climbing leads to a confusing section near the top and finally the anchors. Not a bad route and much better than Mud Tiger.# Location
Back of the Keith Urban Crag.# Protection
8 Bolts to L/O
