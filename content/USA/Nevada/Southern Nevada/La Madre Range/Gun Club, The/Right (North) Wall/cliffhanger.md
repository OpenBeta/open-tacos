# Description
Start up low angle rock to the first bolt as the climbing gets more vertical. Tricky and technical through the next few bolts, especially if you stay true to the bolt line and don't wander onto the route on the right. Finish with anchors just above where the rock turns to the more slabby grey rock.While listed as 5.11d, this felt quite a bit harder than Muzzle Loader to the left, which I felt deserved the 5.12a.# Location
Two bolt lines left of the offwidth corner, this route climbs left of two holes with bushes growing out of them. To the right of Muzzle Loader. The anchors on this route are drop-ins, not the Mussy hooks on the route to the right.# Protection
Bolts to drop-in anchors.
