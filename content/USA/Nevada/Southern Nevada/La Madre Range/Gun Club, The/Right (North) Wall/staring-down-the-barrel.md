# Description
This route has it all: heinous crimps, friction slopers, crack climbing, stemming skills, a roof, dynamic movement, etc. If it were longer it would be an uber-classic!Begin climbing the obvious crack to the huecos and a small bulge. Next head up right through the dihedral to a large roof, traverse right, and then finish up the great dihedral.Note- It is possible to avoid the true crux on this route by going left at the crack up to the huge hueco and continue up through a series of better holds, eventually traversing right at the roof. This drops the rating a few letter grades.# Location
Head right as you face the cliff past the obvious offwidth corner. This line is the fourth to the right and starts in the obvious vertical hand crack.# Protection
Four bolts to rusty chain anchors.
