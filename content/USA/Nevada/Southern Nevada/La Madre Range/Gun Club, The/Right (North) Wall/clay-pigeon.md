# Description
This is a fun route with strenuous moves following the first bolt. The climbing eases as you pass the final bolt with a 20 foot runout to the anchors (easy 5.8 climbing). Use crimps and sidepulls to move upward, veering right below the small roof.The moves off the lower bolts are not entirely obvious.# Location
This is the second route to the right of the large offwidth corner. The first bolts is nearby the awesome pocket.# Protection
4 stainless bolts to double mussy anchor.
