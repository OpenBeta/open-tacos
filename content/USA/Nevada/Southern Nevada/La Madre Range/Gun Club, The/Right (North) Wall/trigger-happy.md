# Description
Not nearly as sharp as its neighbors to the left.  A very reasonable first lead (but see below in italics).# Location
This route is to the left on the right(north) wall. Climbs the slab.  This is maybe 100 yards left from the 5.10 ", and it is about 50 feet right of the farthest left route "Mini-Gun".# Protection
5 bolts to Fixe Lowering Station;It's easy to differentiate this from the other routes as it has different bolts and a different anchor (not mussies).This route was bolted solely for the purpose of allowing for the first ascent, and the first ascent information is posted here solely to document the history of the first ascent. No person should read this posting with the assumption that this route or the fixed gear left behind is safe in any way or otherwise appropriate to allow for safe subsequent ascents. Climbing is dangerous and should only be done with the appropriate training and risk management practices that include providing for the climberÂ’s own safety. Attempting to climb this route as described above or by any other means or methods could result in injury or death.
