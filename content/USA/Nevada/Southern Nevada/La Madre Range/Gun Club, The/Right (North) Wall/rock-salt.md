# Description
Start off a large, flat boulder up an easy (but crumbly) slab to a horizontal break below the first bolt. Continue directly up through a left facing rail feature before standing up onto the horizontal. Continue straight up the sustained technical face.(Note that the route was originally given 5.11c, but this route feels harder than Muzzle Loader to the right).# Location
Start off a large and flat grey boulder on the ground. First two bolts are close together next to a large chalked up left facing sidepull feature.# Protection
6 bolts to chain anchors, shared with Point Blank
