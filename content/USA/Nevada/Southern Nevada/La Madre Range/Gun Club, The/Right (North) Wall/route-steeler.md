# Description
This may be the longest sport route in the urban Vegas area, possibly by a big Much. Given the fact that most routes in this area are graded on a 3-bunny scale, this must necessarily be a 4-bunny route. This is a girdle traverse of all the routes on the easy left side of the Right Side of the canyon. Assume there is an upper left portion of this crag, starting with the 5.6 route at the top left and working down maybe nine bolted lines to a prominent left-facing dihedral. Start at the left-facing dihedral and follow the bolts up and left to the anchor of the left-most route on the wall.# Location
