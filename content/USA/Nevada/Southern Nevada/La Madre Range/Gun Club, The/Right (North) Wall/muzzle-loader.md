# Description
Start up some easy climbing to an undercling at the second bolt.  Pull a weird traverse move to the right and go up through some cool edges.  The crux comes at the top going for the anchors.This route is listed as 12a in many sources, so I listed it here as such.  I felt it was more like 11c.  It seems light for the grade, especially when compared to Rock Salt (11c) to the left and #17 (11d) to the right.  I felt that #17 was the hardest of these three.# Location
This route is 6 from the right.  (Don't forget to count the 5.6 which can be hard to notice).# Protection
6bolts.
