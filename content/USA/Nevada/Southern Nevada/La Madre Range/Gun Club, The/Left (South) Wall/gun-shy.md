# Description
Climb takes you up into a hueco where you can clip the third bolt. The Crux is right before the fourth boltÂ as you're navigating the bulge. Beyond the fourth bolt there's about 20ft of runout of 5.7 climbing (R rating). The fifth bolt and anchors come as the pitch steepens again. You might consider bringing a couple medium sized nuts to protect the runout section if you have some available.# Location
Climb is located directly right of Skeet Surfin' and left of Sharpshooter.# Protection
Four bolts to the runout followed by one more bolt to open/shut anchors.
