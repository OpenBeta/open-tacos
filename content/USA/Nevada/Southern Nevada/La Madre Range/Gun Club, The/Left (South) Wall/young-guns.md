# Description
Leave the ground on steepish rock avoiding the devil bush (velcro bush) and pull up into the pod by the first bolt.  Grab a big comfy jug..clip bolt 2 and do a couple steep moves on good and comfy jugs.  Clip bolt 3 and head up vertical rock on nice edges to the pocket rail.  Clip bolt 4 and climb the technical and sharpish holds to the anchors.# Location
The far right route on the left/shady wall. 25 feet right of Sharpest Shot.  The route was listed as "project" in Islands in the Sky...10+ years later it is now a pretty fun route.# Protection
1 older bolt (still seems solid; circa the rest of the bolts at GC) + 3 stainless bolts and a double mussy anchor.This route was bolted solely for the purpose of allowing for the first ascent, and the first ascent information is posted here solely to document the history of the first ascent.  No person should read this posting with the assumption that this route or the fixed gear left behind is safe in any way or otherwise appropriate to allow for safe subsequent ascents.  Climbing is dangerous and should only be done with the appropriate training and risk management practices that include providing for the climberÂ’s own safety.  Attempting to climb this route as described above or by any other means or methods could result in injury or death.
