# Description
Difficult start move leads to easier climbing to the 2nd bolt. Launch into the crux for a few more bolts, then arrive at a good rest. Awkward climbing for a few more bolts takes you to the anchor.This route shares anchors with Small Arms, so climbing that route makes it easy to hang draws on this one if you want to.# Location
Right side of the wall, starting in an undercut, shallow dihedral just left of the prominent slabby arete.# Protection
7 bolts, open cold shut anchors.
