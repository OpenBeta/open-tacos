# Description
This route is a fun warmup and has some good movement in it. There is a small runout between the third and fourth bolts, but the climbing is on easy, albeit questionable rock. Overall, worth doing. This used to share anchors with High Caliber, so it makes for a good way to hang draws on that route.# Location
On the slabby arete on the far right side of the wall. First route left of the gully that splits the wall. First bolt is high, but easy climbing.# Protection
4 Bolts, open cold shut anchors.
