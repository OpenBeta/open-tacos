# Description
SHARP!   Sharp is an inadequate word to describe the holds on this route.  Pull a steepish start to some slabby moves to a steep ending on sharp rock.# Location
20 Feet Right of Small Arms.  25 feet left of Young Guns.  The first bolt is older (circa most of the other routes at the GC).  The route was listed as  "project" in Islands in the Sky...10+ years later it is now a route.# Protection
1 older bolt (still seems solid).  +4 Stainless Bolts to a double mussy anchor.This route was bolted solely for the purpose of allowing for the first ascent, and the first ascent information is posted here solely to document the history of the first ascent.  No person should read this posting with the assumption that this route or the fixed gear left behind is safe in any way or otherwise appropriate to allow for safe subsequent ascents.  Climbing is dangerous and should only be done with the appropriate training and risk management practices that include providing for the climberÂ’s own safety.  Attempting to climb this route as described above or by any other means or methods could result in injury or death.
