# Description
Bouldery start on slopers and smooth limestone leads to sharp limestone bulge side-pulling, heel hooking, crimping, and smearing!  Surmount the crux/arete to a huge jug and then tiptoe to the top.  There are two bolts here but only one has chains.  Consider continuing up and right to Slingblade (I think?) for actual lowering chains.Took a guess on the rating.  Felt around 12c.  Still some crumbly cauliflower.# Location
Several routes left of High Caliber.  Start on top of a rock and clip a low bolt.  After clipping the second bolt, head straight up.  Alternatively, there is a right-facing, left-leaning dihedral with a crack to lower-off that looks like it's relatively easy.# Protection
6-7 bolts, plus anchors.
