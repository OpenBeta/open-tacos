# Description
Slightly contrived line that avoids the dihedral and arete to climb up an aesthetic blank looking face. Start with your left hand in a triangular pocket low and left. Start right hand on the obvious glizzy. A glizzy is a hotdog. Move to crimps and your on your own from there.# Location
Walk along north bluff and find the first most prominent dihedral. AKA the Glizzy Wall.# Protection
