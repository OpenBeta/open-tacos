# Description
Fun, chill climbing leads to a large ledge. Beware the giant death boulder that is to your right. Above the ledge, the route steepens. Once you pull the crux move, cut right to the anchor.# Location
Dolphin Dance starts in an alcove behind a red bud tree just slightly up-canyon from a little 3 foot tall, polished limestone step-up in the wash. This is the last route encountered in the first group of five climbs in lower Water World. It is on the south side of the canyon and to the right of Stay Golden and Unnamed 5.10a.Travelling further up-canyon beyond Dolphin Dance, you will hit a 6 foot tall scramble up a water-polished pour-off. Beyond this scramble is the next group of climbs (ie., Aquanet, Sea of Oppression, etc.).# Protection
7 protection bolts and a two-bolt anchor.
