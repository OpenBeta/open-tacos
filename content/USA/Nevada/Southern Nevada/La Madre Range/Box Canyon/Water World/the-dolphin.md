# Description
Start at a marble-floor-like, polished section of rock. Continue up incipient cracks through runnels to the top.# Location
The main Water World complex is arrived at after you hang a right (west) at the junction of the two canyons, scramble up a short arÃªte past an enormous pothole on the right, and pull a bouldery move up some polished slab around a large boulder jam featuring a unique chockstone.The Dolphin is the first route encountered shortly past the boulder jam.There are currently five routes here, side by side. Looking up-canyon, the routes are on the left (south) side and they seem to get shade for most of the day.The routes are listed here L-RThe Dolphin 9Wet Goddess 10dStay Golden 10cName Unknown 10bDolphin Dance 10cContinuing up-canyon there is a 8 foot scramble up a steep water polished pour-off and then you will encounter the next group of climbs.# Protection
