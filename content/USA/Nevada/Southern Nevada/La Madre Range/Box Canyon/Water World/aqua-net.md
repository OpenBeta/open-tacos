# Description
Start climbing at the orange recess through very steep rock. The crux comes pretty quickly. After a rest go first left then traverse right into the V-shaped groove. Rest at the ledge then do some big stemming through runnels to the top.# Location
The two main areas of Water World are separated by a six foot tall scramble up water polished rock. Aqua Net is just left of Seas of Oppression in the upper section of Water World. Left of Aqua Net are two other routes.# Protection
9 bolts. The anchor is shared with Seas of Oppression.
