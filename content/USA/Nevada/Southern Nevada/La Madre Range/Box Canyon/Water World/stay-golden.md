# Description
Stay Golden starts behind a tree. There is a small section of smooth, white, marble-like rock at the beginning. A large orange streak looms above. Encounter a medium size cavity mid-way up and then climb pockets through the orange streak and get a good rest on a jug before setting off on the vertical crux to some runnels that lead to the anchor.# Location
Stay Golden is located in the middle of the first group of five climbs encountered in the lower section of Water World.# Protection
8 protection bolts and a two-bolt anchor.
