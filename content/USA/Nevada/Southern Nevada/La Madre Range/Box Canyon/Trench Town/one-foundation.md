# Description
One Foundation is a really high quality, long, well-bolted and sustained 5.10 climb on blue-grey limestone. Highly recommended. Rappel with two ropes.# Location
One Foundation is in Trench Town. Located to the right of a pair of 5.9 sport lines, the route begins on the right side of a pillar. There are small caves on either side of the start. Looking up-canyon, these routes are on the left or east side. The route is likely to receive sun mid-day, but has shade in the morning and late afternoon onward.There is a 5.11c route on the right side of One Foundation that starts on the other side of the second cave. There is also a 5.11 route somewhere across the canyon opposite this route.# Protection
15 protection bolts, 2 bolt anchor. Rappel with two ropes.
