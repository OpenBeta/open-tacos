# Description
# Location
Pincushion Peak looms north of Red Rock in the La Madre range, and next to "Little Red Rock". Integrity Ridge is at times difficult to distinguish, and other times plainly obvious, as the limestone blends into the other faces in the area. It can be seen nearly anywhere from town. I always wanted to put an adventure route up so people could climb even if the weather did not cooperate with rain.# Protection
a 35m rope workedsingle rack from .1-2 camalots, double from .4-.75. In addition to this, tricams black-red are golden, but the route would go fine without them. If this is your first time on limestone trad, be weary of cam placements, and especially small cams. Tricams are your friends. The gear was actually pretty good!About 8 slings, cordalettes for odd anchor setups. While there is loose rock around it it was really pretty clean climbing. We did a little more cleaning the second time around. Not wearing a helmet would probably be the worst thing you could do.
