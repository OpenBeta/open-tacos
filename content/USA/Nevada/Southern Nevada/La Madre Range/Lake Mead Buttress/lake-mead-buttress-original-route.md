# Description
Just to the right of the prow is a crack/seam system that starts from a horizontal crack 20' off the ground. There's a baby angle piton in the horizontal where the seam starts, which is also the first piece of protection. Climb this for a hundred feet or so until easier climbing leads left onto the shallow prow. This is the hardest and most committing pitch of the route, the rest of the pitches are 5.8 or less. Follow the prow, sometimes jogging left, to the top. We did this in four pitches but it can be broken up into more. All of the belays have a decent ledge and the multitude of crack/seam systems offer more than one way to the next belay, so choose carefully. The climbing is adventurous with some run outs and a fair amount loose rock spread out over the solid stuff.# Location
