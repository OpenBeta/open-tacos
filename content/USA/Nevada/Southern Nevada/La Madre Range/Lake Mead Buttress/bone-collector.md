# Description
Start a little ways left of the prow on the easiest looking section, about halfway to the big cleft higher on the wall. Follow cracks and ledges staying left of the prow. We did this in four pitches but there're many places to belay. The climbing is continuous lower down and gets more ledgy higher up with half a pitch of 3rd & 4th class just before the top. Lots of loose rock.To descend head east along the top, past the saddle, and summit the next pointy peak. From the top take the southeast ridge to near the bottom then angle down and right.# Location
A short ways left of the prow.# Protection
Stoppers, double set of cams- micro to 3" and one 4".
