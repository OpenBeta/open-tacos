# Description
Step across to the wall from the top of a boulder in the gully left of Might as Well. Continue up weaving very slightly past 9 bolts to the anchor. Sustained climbing at the grade that only let's up around 20 feet before the anchors, and then back at it for a tricky last 15 feet.# Location
Facing Might as Well, descend a gully to the left. Sunday's Child is the first well-bolted straight up line encountered.# Protection
9 bolts.
