# Description
On the left side of Dali Dome, MC1 starts to the right of a small tree and flake. The hardest moves seem to be at the second bolt. Follow the bolts to a small ledge, then traverse out right past a bolt with no hanger to a flake. Climb onto the flake, then follow easier, but runout, terrain to the anchors. Rap off with two ropes.# Location
