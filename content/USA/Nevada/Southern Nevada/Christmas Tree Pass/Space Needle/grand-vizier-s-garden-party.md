From the top of the ledge go up face 100' past two bolts to gigantic ledge.(2) Up trough past two bolts to small horizontal dike, then up past one more bolt to large horizontal dike.(3) Up and right 100' past several bolts to a six foot pothole, then right and up past two more bolts to a small horizontal dike with belay bolts.(4) Up and left 12' to a bolt, then left around the corner and up to a bolt. Up 25' to a bolt, then up 30' to the top.Dick Richardson may return from his grave to spank me for whining, BUT this route would be a lot safer if someone added a couple of additional bolts.# Location

Bolts and a few small nuts and friends. Bring bolt replacement tools.
