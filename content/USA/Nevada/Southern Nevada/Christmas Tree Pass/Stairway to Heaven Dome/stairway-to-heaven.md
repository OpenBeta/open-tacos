# Description
The East face of Stairway to Heaven Dome is found at the east side of the Main Area.  The crux comes at end of pitch one, pinching small nipples on a steep face with very thin feet.  The second pitch difficulties come after traversing left to the finishing dike: reachy and good holds.# Location
# Protection
Bolts, supplemented by small pro for pitch one, and bolts for pitch two.  Rap the route with a single 70m rope. The anchors at the very top need to be lowered a couple feet to make the pull easier.
