# Description
Small crux at the start getting up towards the crack. You may want a stickclip to protect that blank move.Go up the slab, clip, get up to the horizontal alcove. Pull up into the vertical crack and follow it most of the way up clipping a bolt here and there and placing pro. The crack generally widens as it goes up. Shallow hands, to fists, to arm bar. Go up and left to the anchors.The bolts and anchor bolts all look nice!(2010 I think it said? But they look new!)Might want to bring some webbing like most routes out here.# Location
Big crack on the side facing Dali Dome.# Protection
Mixed. Standard trad rack and quick draws.
