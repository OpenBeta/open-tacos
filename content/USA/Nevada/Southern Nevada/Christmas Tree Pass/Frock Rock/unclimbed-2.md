Another fun short route that should be climbed. Starts as a slanted finger crack up and right. Then to a leaning dihedral with a small finger/pinscar crack. (Might be big enough for tiny stuff?Would be a fun skill-test. and would top out at the same ledge as the previous route.# Location
Just to the right of the unclimbed route 1.# Protection
Trad rack nothing bigger than a #1. doubles of smaller stuff
