# Description
Beautiful brown squeeze chimney on excellent rock.  Lots of knee bars, some arm bars. The exit is exciting and well protected.# Location
To get to the base of the route either approach MDM Dome/Saddle Crag from the east and 4th-class slab/house-sized boulders, or hike in from west to the notch in the center of formation and continue down the north face between the domes.The brown squeeze has two large blocks wedged at the start.Rap the route with a 60m rope.# Protection
Nuts to #6 Friend; could put lots deep inside the chimney.  Two rap hangers.
