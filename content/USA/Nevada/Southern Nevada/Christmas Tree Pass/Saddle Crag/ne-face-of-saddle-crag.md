# Description
The route follows a distinct crack system up the right side of the east face.  Pitch 2 goes up and left on easy rock to gain upper crack.  Pitch 3 has crux at start, hand traverse left and gain second crack, nice hands to belay at final crack and top.  You could try to wander north at summit to find rap for Funnel of Love and TR that route or wander south and down to small grove of trees where we rapped to exposed slab, unroped and 4th classed north to large boulder with sling for second and final rap; use double 60m ropes.# Location
Start at the far right side of the east face of largest dome in the east end of Main Area. Two starts are possible, from house sized boulders, work your way thru to easy crack (Chemical Ali 5.2) heading up to bolted anchor. For start #2, the slabby bolted line (Tough Shiites, 5.7)# Protection
Doubles in mid range cams, nuts, hexes: first belay bolted, others are not.
