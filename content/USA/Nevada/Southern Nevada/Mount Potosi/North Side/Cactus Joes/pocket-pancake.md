# Description
This is a fun techy slab route with a very distinct crux right before the last bolt.  Head up easy slab on good holds until you clip the second to last bolt and wonder where all of the holds went.  Find some itty bitty micro crimps and do a couple of hard moves to gain the last bolt where the climbing again eases up to the chains.  Short crux, but it is entertaining none the less.# Location
Obvious slab route that looks a bit spacey between the 3rd and 4th bolts from the ground (don't worry, the climbing in that section is easy).  The route is located at about the center of the wall, though there are many more routes to the left of this one than to the right.# Protection
5 bolts to 2 chain anchor.
