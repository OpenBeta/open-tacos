# Description
This route is a lot of fun, interesting climbing throughout with a bit of a stumper crux at the 2nd to last bolt.  Climbs the slightly overhanging rock with interesting cruxy sequences followed by good rests pretty much the whole way up.  At the top, the anchors are up and right from the last bolt on a ledge.# Location
This is in the middle of the cliff between Gluteal Glochids on the left and Cactus Cowboy on the right.  This is the second route to the right of spineless, the short, chossy 5.8 that goes up the spine of brown rock in the center of the wall.# Protection
9 bolts to 2 chain anchor with steel lowering biners.
