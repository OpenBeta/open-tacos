# Description
Interesting little route that packs a bit of a punch for the grade down low, then eases up in difficulty quite a bit for the top 2/3 of the route.  The route starts up a slab with some interesting thin and balancy moves right around the 2nd bolt where the crux is encountered.  After gaining the good holds right of the second bolt it's an easy jaunt up the good corner crack system above.  The first two bolts have chain permadraws on them, though I'm not quite sure why.# Location
Center of the wall, just left of the Pocket Pancake Slab.# Protection
7 bolts to 2 chain anchor, first 2 bolts have chain permadraws on them.
