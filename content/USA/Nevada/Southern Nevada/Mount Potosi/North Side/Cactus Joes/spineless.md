# Description
This is a short route the climbs some of the worst looking rock on the wall.  It is steeper than it looks from the ground and is almost vertical as it climbs past three bolts before rounding out onto a chossy low angled slab and heading way left to the anchors on the top of scorpion ledge.  Really not worth climbing, but it might be a good way to access the scorpion ledge if you are just looking to do one of the upper portions of the routes starting on the ledge.# Location
This is the short route that climbs the chossy looking right side of an obvious brown ridge of rock in the left/central portion of the wall.# Protection
3 bolts to two bolt anchor way left of the top of the route.  Anchors have a biner and an open clevis for lowering off of.
