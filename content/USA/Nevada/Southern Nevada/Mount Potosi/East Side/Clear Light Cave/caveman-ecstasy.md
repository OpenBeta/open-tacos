# Description
This links Captain Caveman (12c) on the lower tier of the cave into Countdown to Ecstasy (13a) on the upper tier. While logical, it's not really any harder than Countdown because of the unavoidable rest before heading out the roof.Start in the corner to the right of Power Windows and climb Captain Caveman (45 feet, 6 bolts) to anchors below the enormous roof. Continue out the pocketed, gymnastic roof for another 40 horizontal feet passing 10 more bolts along the way. A brilliant pitch!# Location
# Protection
16 bolts, two-bolt anchor.
