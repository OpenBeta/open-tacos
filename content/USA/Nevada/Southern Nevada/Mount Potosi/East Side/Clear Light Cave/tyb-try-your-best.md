# Description
Jared used to have TYB written on the toes of his climbing shoes to remind him to give it his all! This route has a slopey pocket at the crux and a long whip if you blow it. When working the route, it can be normal to avoid clipping the anchors and jump off to avoid the rope drag.# Location
Climb PMA and keep heading out the roof.# Protection
