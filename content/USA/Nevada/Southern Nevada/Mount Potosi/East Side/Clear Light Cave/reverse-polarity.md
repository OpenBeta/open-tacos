# Description
A steep, sloper/pinch-fest on incredibly solid rock. Really cool movement. Recommend kneepads on both legs.# Location
To the left of Mon Pote Assis (14a), there is a small cave capped with guano. This route starts at the left side of this small cave at a small roof. Climb the roof then the seriously steep rock above. Finish at an anchor at the horizontal break.# Protection
