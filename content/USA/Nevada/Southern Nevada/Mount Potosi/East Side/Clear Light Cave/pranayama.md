# Description
Get Pumped! The full route continues out at 13c, and then further at 14c. Nice to have the short options to have some ticks at "easier" grades.# Location
Begin on Whammo. Climb 2 bolts, then traverse left onto a ledge to the 6th bolt. Then head out the roof for 3 more bolts to a two bolt anchor. You may want to either use 2 ropes and drop one at the 6th bolt or downclimb and clean the first 5 bolts to reduce drag.# Protection
9 bolts plus anchors
