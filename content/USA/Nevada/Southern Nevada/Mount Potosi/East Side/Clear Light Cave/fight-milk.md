# Description
Start on the east 10 in the center of the wall that is the access route to Pyramayama. Trolley your rope across the wall clipping one and I clipping the previous draw till you reach the mon potasi anchors. Head straight out the roof and meet up with end of Pyramayama.recently a hold broke a the beginning. a natural sequence was promptly figured out and the route goes at the same grade or a half grade harder. shouldn't affect the grade for Crowteine.# Location
Continue from mon potasi anchors.# Protection
