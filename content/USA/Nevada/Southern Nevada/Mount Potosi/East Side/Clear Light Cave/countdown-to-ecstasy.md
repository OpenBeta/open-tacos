# Description
Despite some controversial methods for developing this (among many) routes in the cave, this is possibly the most fun one can have on a roof at this grade. Sustained handlebars and three finger pockets among numerous toe and heel hooks lead out to the lip. Would be 4 stars if it were all natural!# Location
Starts at top of Captain Caveman, but can also be accessed as if starting Whamo (11b) and moving left along 5.10 climbing. Recommend up-clipping each draw to reduce rope drag.# Protection
