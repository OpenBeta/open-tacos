# Description
This is the third route right of the the small cave in the middle of the Clear Light Cave. Begin by climbing up to the ledge clipping one bolt. From there, pull a couple of difficult moves from the second bolt to the third. A series of underclings gets you to a couple of liebacking moves. Move left to the anchors, which is quite difficult. If you get to the anchors you might as well try one of the harder extensions above!# Location
