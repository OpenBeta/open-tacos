# Description
Despite the appearance of a pile of choss, this actually climbs very well. Some jug hauling to a V6 deadpoint crux to some easier climbing at the top.# Location
The direct start to Countdown to Ecstasy (13a), start in the deepest part of the cave, in the middle of the upper ledge. Climb through the weakness in the rock all the way up to the roof.# Protection
Fixed draws
