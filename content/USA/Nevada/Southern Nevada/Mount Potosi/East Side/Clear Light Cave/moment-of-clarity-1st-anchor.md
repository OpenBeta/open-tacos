# Description
While most would consider this route their warm-up for the cliff, it is a fantastic climb in its own right. Consistent, good holds lead you through two distinct and interesting cruxes on your way to the chains. While you will have to climb above your bolt on this one, its not far and the moves are secure.# Location
This route starts in the Clarity Cave, the small cave in the center of the Clear Light Cave, behind the brick wall. Clip the low draw, then pull onto the wall and move slightly right to start the route off the ledge above, following the line of bolts to your left to an anchor at the roof.# Protection
5 bolts to a lower off.
