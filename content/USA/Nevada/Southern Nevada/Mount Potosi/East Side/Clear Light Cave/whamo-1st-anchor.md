# Description
Most use this route to access Pranayama and other hard climbs on the ceiling, but if you're looking for a fun romp up the cave wall at a mellow grade, this is it. Start off on easy climbing, thinking you're getting away with an easy 5.11 until very steep climbing awaits you a bolt or two before the chains. Enjoy the cool tufas and jugs on this one.# Location
Starts above the Clarity Cave on the upper tier, step right and clip the first draw, then trend straight up and take the right hand line to a set of chains hanging in the ceiling above.# Protection
bolts to a lower off.
