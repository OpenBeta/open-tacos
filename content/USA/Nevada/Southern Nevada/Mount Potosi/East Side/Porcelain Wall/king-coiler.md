# Description
Might be difficult for shorter folks to clip the first bolt. The name for this route and the nest one - Pinched Loaf - come from the little coil of human poo I found at the base of the cliff before I opened the routes.# Location
Start off a small ledge 25ft left and in front of a large pine tree.# Protection
5 bolts
