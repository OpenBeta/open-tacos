# Description
When looking up, the climb seem to have a lot of holds .... and it kind of does. When looking up, it also seems as the path of the climb is pretty obvious, but its just not.Note: One bolts was added and one moved at the bottom to make the use of a stick Clip for the first bolt no longer necessary.  I would still strongly suggest the belayer clip into any of a number of the bolts positioned along the wall on this ledge.# Location
8 feet to the right of Zygoats,# Protection
6 bolts plus anchors
