# Description
Start by climbing Mr. B & Mr. B goes to Vegas; rest as long as you so chose at both ledges. Mr. B's wild Ride starts by initially moving right, but then ventures straight up a slabby-Vert section to the anchors only a few feet from the top of the Porcelain Wall. I suggest placing longer draws on the last two bolts of Mr. B and the first three bolts of Mr. B goes to Vegas as this will reduce rope drag at the top of the last pitch.  The climb is just a hair over 40 Meters, but the vertical height is shorter because the climb traverses to the right by about 5 meters.  An alternate easier route is to climb the 5.10a first pitch of Pops.# Location
# Protection
26 bolts, chains and carabiners at the anchors. A mid point lower point is also available at the ledge at the anchor of Mr. B goes to Vegas.
