# Description
Start on the ledge that Hyper-U begins on. This older climb is bolted sparingly and finished even more so.  Way good fun, but a bit run out at the top!Note: I recommend the belayer clip into any of a number of the bolts positioned along the wall on this ledge.# Location
15ft right of Hyper-U# Protection
15 bolts
