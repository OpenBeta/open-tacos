# Description
Climb either Pops (5.8) or Mr. B (5.10b/c); the start of starts between these routes. This line climbs another 10 bolts (60+ feet) up and on to a 1.5' wide ledge at the anchors. Note: Due to the length of the rest that's possible on the ledge... the grade is the same (5.11a). I just happen to like the full value of putting in two 3+ star climbs on top of each other.# Location

15 bolts plus anchors
