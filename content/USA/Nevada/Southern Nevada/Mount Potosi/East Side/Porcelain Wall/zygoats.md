# Description
You will wonder where the 5.11a part is up until section between the last bolt and the jug at the anchors. If you are tall... you may be able to skip this crux (5.10b)Note: I recommend the belayer clip into any of a number of the bolts positioned along the wall on this ledge.# Location
near the left middle of the upper ledge area. About 8 to the right of the old climb Hyper U.# Protection
6 bolts plus anchors
