# Description
Fun climbing up great features the whole way.# Location
# Protection
Stainless bolts to mussys (I think this is the one where the anchors are kind of off right of the rest of the bolt line.)This route was bolted solely for the purpose of allowing for the first ascent, and the first ascent information is posted here solely to document the history of the first ascent. No person should read this posting with the assumption that this route or the fixed gear left behind is safe in any way or otherwise appropriate to allow for safe subsequent ascents. Climbing is dangerous and should only be done with the appropriate training and risk management practices that include providing for the climberÂ’s own safety. Attempting to climb this route as described above or by any other means or methods could result in injury or death.
