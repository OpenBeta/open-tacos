# Description
This route is of extremely high quality.  Great rock, movement and length.  It just might be the best single pitch sport 5.10A in Las Vegas.  Do it!Starts just left of a large rock leaning on the cliff.  Climb a thin start to a runnel romp of a good time for 100 feet!  Several thoughtful cruxes.CLASSIC!# Location
