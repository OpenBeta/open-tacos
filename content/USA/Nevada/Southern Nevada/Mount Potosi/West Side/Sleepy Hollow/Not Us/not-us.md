# Description
2 distinct crux sections. First pulling back into the dihedral after the first roof. Trend slightly left, right after the first crux to gain better holds and plug in gear. Continue up the dihedral to a layback, crux #2. Gear is G from the start of crux #2Rock has semi fragile very tiny stalagmites be careful where you trust your feet and avoid the face holds above the first roof.
