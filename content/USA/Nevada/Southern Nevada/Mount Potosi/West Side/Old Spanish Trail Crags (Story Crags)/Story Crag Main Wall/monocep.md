# Description
Easy climbing leads to face climbing boulder problem.  More easy climbing leads to fun roof pull, up runnels to top. Lower off with 70m.This was my first addition to the Story Crag Main Wall.  The bolts are a bit spaced on the easy sections, and well bolted at the cruxes.  Stick clipping the first bolt is advisable.# Location
Once you locate the hanging left facing corner for Hop On Pop-Pop.    This is two routes to the left.# Protection
16 bolts, anchors
