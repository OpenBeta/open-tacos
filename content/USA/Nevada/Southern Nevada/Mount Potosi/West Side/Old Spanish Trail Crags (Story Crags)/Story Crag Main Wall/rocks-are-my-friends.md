# Description
The OG route at the cliff. Jon put this route in ground up solo, establishing this classic line. This is the route that inspired me to develop more climbs here.  Climb the long technical face that is punctuated with plentiful rests. Be aware that the route goes to the left through some large holds at about 40-50 feet up the wall.  You can go straight up here, but it is easier out left.  A long and complex pitch.  2 rappels on 60m or 70m, long runners for climbing.  Look for the rap station which is climber's left of the route at about halfway.# Location
Practically the middle of the wall .  Look for the faint groove/corner that is between the two obvious orange patches on the wall. (Route #12 in the topo photo)# Protection
26 bolts, anchors. Rap station about halfway down.
