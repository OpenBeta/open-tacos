# Description
This is the first of the super long routes you will encounter on the cliff.  This one goes on forever! Climb up a face to a shallow left facing corner. Go up the technical and steep face to juggy low angle rock. Boulder problem finish.# Location
Look for the obvious hanging left facing corner.  This route is about 100ft left of where the approach trail meets the wall.# Protection
