# Description
These two pitches can be linked with a 60m and long runners, expect some rope drag.. First pitch starts on left side of V-notch which is followed up to the top of the pillar.  Climb through funky side pulls and exit left to gain a corner.  Again head left to pull a roof.  Second pitch starts with easy face climbing off right to gain the technical corner. Up face and runnels to top.  Each pitch is 30m, two 30m rappels to ground.# Location
Locate the V-notch near the base of the wall.  This route climbs up the left hand side of that feature. It is also the route that goes through the left side of the obvious roof feature on this side of the wall.   (Route #11 in the topo photo)# Protection
25 bolts for both pitches, anchors
