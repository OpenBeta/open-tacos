# Description
One of the last routes I put in before I moved away and I can't believe I hadn't discovered this amazing path through the wall until so late in the game.Slab climbing leads to a small ledge.  Leave the ledge and climb steep juggy face through the orange rock.  Finish over the roof. Lower with a 70m.# Location
This route goes through the center of the 1st orange patch of rock you encounter as you work your way down the cliff.  It finishes just over the large roof that splits the wall here. (Route #10 on the topo photo)# Protection
