# Description
Technical face climbing leads to a roof pull into a hanging corner.  More technical face climbing leads to another strange pull over a roof into a second hanging corner. Lower off with 60m.# Location
A little less than halfway down the wall you will see a large roof about 70 feet up the wall. This is the route that dead ends on the right hand side of the roof.  (Route #7 in the topo photo)# Protection
