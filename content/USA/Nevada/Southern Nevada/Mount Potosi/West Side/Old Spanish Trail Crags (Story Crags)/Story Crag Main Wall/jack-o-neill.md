# Description
Long technical face leads to 3 roofs in the sky.  2 rappels on 60m or 70m, long runners for climbing. This route was Jon's first 12a making it a special first ascent for him.  When you are on the technical orange face that marks the end of the first half of the route, think about the fact that Jon forgot to install the bolt in the middle of that section, and ran it out like a boss for the FA! (The bolt has since been installed for future parties)This route is in memorial of the legendary surfing innovator, Jack O'Neill who passed shortly before the FA of this route.# Location
This is the long route just left of Rocks Are My Friends.  It is the third route to the right of the large orange arch feature. (Route #13 on the topo photo)# Protection
20 bolts, anchors. Rap station about halfway down.
