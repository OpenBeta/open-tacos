# Description
Boulder problem start to pumpy jugs leads to a technical corner finish.   Lower off with a 60m. This is the best of the trio of routes that leaves the ledge system.  Possibly my favorite route at the cliff.To get to the start of the route, traverse out across the ledge clipping the bolted anchor stations as you go.  You can either bring your belayer over, or you can clip in to the anchor, have your belayer go down below the ledge to the ground and belay from there.# Location
This is the last of the three routes that leaves the ledge system.  Access by going across the hand line to the small cave feature. (Route #5 on the topo photo)# Protection
9 bolts, anchors
