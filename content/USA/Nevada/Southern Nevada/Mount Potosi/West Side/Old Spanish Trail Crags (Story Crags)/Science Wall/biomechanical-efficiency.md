# Description
Boulder problem through first 3 bolts leads to pumpy jugs followed by a heartbreaking boulder problem at the finish.  Lower off with a 60m.To get to the start of the route, traverse out across the ledge clipping the bolted anchor stations as you go.  You can either bring your belayer over, or you can clip in to the anchor, have your belayer go down below the ledge to the ground and belay from there.# Location
This is the middle route of the trio that leaves the ledge near the small cave.  Access by going across the hand line to the small cave feature.  (Route #4 on the topo photo)# Protection
8 bolts, anchors
