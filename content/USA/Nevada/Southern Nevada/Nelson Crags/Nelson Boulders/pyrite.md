# Description
Lowball. Start with your right hand on a tricky pinch around the right side of the arete, and your left hand very low on a sloper/undercling. Move up the arete and turn the lip. Either jump down from here, or continue up the slab to the apex of the boulder full the full adventure.Beta video:instagram.com/p/CHWesOxjHSNâ€¦;# Location
