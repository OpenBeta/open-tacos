# Description
On the face between Disneyesque and the left facing large corner are a couple of cracks and very shallow corners/flakes that lead up and slightly to the right to join the big corner. The rock is loose but the climbing relatively safe. I did not find the anchor to this one and it appears that you could break left to reach the anchors of Disneyesque towards the top. I did not, until I had passed the anchors about 6-7 feet to my left and climbed harder territory, past an overhang and some blocks. Beware.# Location
Just to the left of the large corner, and to the right of disneyesque.# Protection
Good selection of gear up to #3, maybe a #4 BD. See above for word on anchors.
