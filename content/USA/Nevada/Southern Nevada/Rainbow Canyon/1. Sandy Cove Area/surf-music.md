# Description
Spectacular face climb on good quality rock. Get your mental game on, as most of this climb is very friction-dependent. The bolts are spaced quite far apart, with some insecure moves in some places. Make sure you are confident at the grade. That being said, this is a great sport climb, and one that should not be missed. Above the first bolt, the climbing is PG13. Getting to the first bolt is a bit headier, as it is very high off the ground. A stick clip may not even reach!# Location
Located on the beautiful north-facing wall in Sandy Cove Area #2. Obvious bolt line straight up the middle/right side of the face.# Protection
Climb past 5 bolts to a set of anchors.
