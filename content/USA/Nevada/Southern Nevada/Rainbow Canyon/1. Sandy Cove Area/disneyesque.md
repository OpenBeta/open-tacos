# Description
Thin to hands crack leads up to off-width climbing. About half way up, the crack turns 90 degrees to the right for 5-6 feet and eventually turns sharply upward again never leaving off-width size. Fun and interesting moves.# Location
Obvious crack in the middle of Sandy Cove Area #1 in Michelle's book.# Protection
Standard rack with larger sizes for the off-width sections. You could bring doubles of 5-8" and place them all. Bolted anchors.
