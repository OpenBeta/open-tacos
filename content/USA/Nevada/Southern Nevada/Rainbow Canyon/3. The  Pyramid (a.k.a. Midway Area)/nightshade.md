# Description
Sustained, really fun and thin edge pulling get you up this slightly more than vertical face. As with most other Locatelli/Harrison routes, the well bolted nature of the route only becomes clear once you make the moves from bolt to bolt and the edges reveal themselves.# Location
The first route to the left of Cheap Motel.# Protection
Bolts.
