# Description
Start up a bomb bay chimney (not visible in beta picture) to a left diagonaling perfect hand crack that ends all too quickly in a slightly chossy right facing corner. Climb the corner up to a roof which is exited to the left and continue up to the anchor. This upper part to the roof is a little heady. The anchor, made up of two bolts, is questionable. You can use a lower anchor around the corner to the left (anchor for Nightshade), but it is a little goofy.# Location
Left side of Midway #5 area in Michelle's book.# Protection
Hand sized gear for the initial crack and then a variety of gear including larger gear for the upper part. A BD #4 and #5 would get placed.
