# Description
Basalt Shaker climbs a nice, shady face but is unfortunately not very good.  Very easy (5.8) climbing leads to a final bolt where the angle kicks back presenting a 5.10+ crux.  The anchors are very difficult to clip due to a choice between a disintegrating clipping hold or a big lock off from a much better, and lower, hold.# Location

Draws and a yellow Alien for a horizontal before the anchor.
