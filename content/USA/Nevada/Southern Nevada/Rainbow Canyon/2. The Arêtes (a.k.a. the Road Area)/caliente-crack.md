# Description
This climb has a lack-luster first pitch but the second pitch makes it a worthwhile endeavor.Pitch 1: Begin at the left side of a buttress.  There is a single bolt about 15 ft off the ground.  Pull a cruxy 5.10- move to get to the bolt.  Continue up easier ground with sporadic protection to a ledge with bolted anchors.Pitch 2:  This is an amazing pitch!  It goes from tight hands to hands up a wide angled dihedral.  Savor every jam with great protection to bolted anchors.# Location
The route lies about 50ft to the right of the large corner mentioned for this area.  Begin below a single bolt near an arete on the left side of a blocky buttress.# Protection
standard rack to #3.5 camalot.
