# Description
AF1 takes the nice curving arete-feature just left of the long right-facing corner crack in the center of Rainbow Canyon.  Begin up that climb and then bust left to the first bolt and balance and reach your way up a series of thin edges on nice rock.  The position on this one is great.# Location
?# Protection
A 0.75 Camalot and a #3 Camalot are nice for the start, then draws only.
