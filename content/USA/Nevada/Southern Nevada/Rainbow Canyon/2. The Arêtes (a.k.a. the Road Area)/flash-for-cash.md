# Description
Delicately climb up a thin crack and face past a few horizontals to a bolted anchor. Fun and sustained and thoughtful climbing make this a great route.# Location
Second route to the left of Sexual Basalt.# Protection
Although this route may seem run-out,it is reasonably well protected against a bad fall if you are confident at the grade. If you prefer, you can also supplement the bolts with small gear.
