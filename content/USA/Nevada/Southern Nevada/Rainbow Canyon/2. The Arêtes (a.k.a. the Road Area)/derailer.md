# Description
This crack is great if you like finger cracks. there are plenty of good locks and good feet where you need them. I didn't find a definitive crux. Seems you can just cruise right along and if you need a rest you can always find a position for it.# Location
This starts in a right facing corner with poor/ sandy rock quality and you can't miss the splitter going strait up the face. I started here but you can also scramble up to the ledge on the left and belay/begin there. you won't find any quality protection until you're on the ledge anyways. from there up it is great.# Protection
Single rack .1-3 camalot and you can double up around .4 .5  if you want to button up some sections
