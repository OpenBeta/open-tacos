# Description
Fun vertical and horizontal edge pulling lead up the arete to an eventual turn onto the right face after 3 bolts. Getting past the initial 2 bolts is the crux and leads to easier climbing above. The start is more difficult for the vertically challenged.# Location
Left most route on what is called Road Area #3 in Michelle's book. Start at the arete and quickly get into some steep territory that mellows after the second bolt.# Protection
Sport route. Bolts and bolted anchor on top.
