# Description
A tricky boulder problem start leads to about 10 feet of easier climbing, and then the pump clock starts.  A long series of cryptic thin face climbing takes you to the arete on the right.  Trying to gain the arete is the true crux, but the arete above is no easy task either.  I believe the route is called Schwing Time because if you blow it while up on the arete, you will be schwinging.# Location
This is at the left end of the Midway area.  You can't miss the beautiful orange streak.  This route also shares a few bolts with the 12+ to the left.# Protection
8-9 bolts, lower off
