# Description
Boulder up some difficult edge climbing to the first bolt and clip off of a decent hold. From there you wander up chasing the best edges. As with other RH/ML routes, the bolts sometimes feel as they just barely make the route safe, but maybe that's just an illusion. I'm 5'6 and this felt reachy and 10+.# Location
Right of Back Bumper and the leftmost route in Road Area #2 per Locatelli guide.# Protection
Bolts to bolted anchor.
