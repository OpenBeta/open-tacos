# Description
Hard, bouldery moves lead to tricky finger locks.  Gear is tricky to place, especially at the beginning.  This route is given 5.8 in the book, so I gave it that grade as well.  I felt that this thing was 10/10+.# Location
This climb is toward the left hand side of the cliff.  Locate the curving crack that starts about halfway up the wall, and then look right for a right leaning finger sized crack that joins up with a wide corner.  Start on a ledge that is about 6 feet off the ground.# Protection
double set of cams to #2 camalot, a #4 camalot could be used as well, but is not needed.  Small wires are helpful.
