# Description
Begin up the back wall of the cave on smooth bubbly rock and gain the obvious horizontal weakness below the roof. Make a big move to reach a large rail, and then hold it together on small holds pulling onto the slabbyÂ head wall.# Location
There are two bolted lines starting in the main cave. Natural Selection is on the right, and an open project is on the left.# Protection
