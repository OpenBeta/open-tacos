# Description
This is a really fun route that climbs a steeper section of the wall than most of the surrounding routes.  Lots of runnels on the climb end up being used more like tufas as you pinch the rock between the runnels.  The crux is in the center of the route as you climb the steepest section with the fewest runnels.# Location
5th route from the left of the wall, first route to the right of the big cave in the center or the wall.# Protection
Bolts to ring anchors (shared with route to the left).
