# Description
This is a fun route that is quite varied in nature.  Begin with some easy liebacking up the obvious right facing crack for the first couple of bolts.  After the crack section ends, continue up the somewhat runout but easy grippy slab to a big ledge.  After the ledge the crux is encountered as you climb the steep and sharp section of the rock for a couple of bolts, then finish up with some more slab to the anchors.# Location
Third route from the left.  Look for the obvious jagged crack with 2 bolts with tan painted hangers next to the crack.# Protection
Bolts to ring anchors.
