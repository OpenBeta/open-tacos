# Description
This is a fun (though quite sharp) route that ascends through the slabby rock to follow the really big off-width type of runnel for the second half of the route.  The crux is encountered where the rock turns vertical in the lower section of the big runnel.  Surmount this crux with interesting stemming movement through the corner.# Location
7th route from the left side of the wall, and second route to the right of the big cave in the middle of the wall.# Protection
bolts to chain anchors.
