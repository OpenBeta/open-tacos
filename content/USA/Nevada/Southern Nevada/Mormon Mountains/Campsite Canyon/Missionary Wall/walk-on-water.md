# Description
This is a really fun route that is much easier than it looks from the ground. Â Begin by climbing through an interesting groove section with lots of runnels that can be used as pinches and side pulls, after the runnel section, finish up with some easy slab to the anchors.# Location
4th route from the left side of the crag, first route to the left of the obvious crack.# Protection
Bolts to ring anchors (shared with route to the right).
