# Description
This is a fun little slab route up nice (though sharp) runneled grey limestone.  The route traverses from left to right across the rock and the crux is roughly halfway up the route.  This would be a great first lead.# Location
This is the fourth route encountered on the campsite crag.# Protection
8 bolts to 2 bolt anchor
