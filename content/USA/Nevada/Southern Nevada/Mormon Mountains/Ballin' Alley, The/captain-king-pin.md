# Description
A short and somewhat powerful route, this is the first climb you will come to in the Alley, about 200 yards before the actual cave. Following the steep and bouldery overhang up the (somewhat) obvious bolt line, the crux comes after the third bolt with a series of big moves to moderate holds, leading to slightly easier climbing to the top. An excellent route that could use a bit more traffic to clear off the excess choss left and right of the bolt line.# Location
# Protection
5 Bolts, 2 fixed draws for anchors.
