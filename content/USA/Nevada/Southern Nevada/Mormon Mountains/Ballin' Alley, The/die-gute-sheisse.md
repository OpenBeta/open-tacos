The prize line of the Alley. This line veers off the right edge of the cave, climbing 6o feet or so to a no hands rest. From there follow the final headwall up and left to the anchors. The crux comes past the 8th bolt with a powerful move to a sloper and a difficult sequence through the next two clips.# Location
Following the outer rim of the right side of the cave, past "A Perfect Game" There are 3-4 bolts to the left of the line, an unfinished bolting project at the moment.# Protection
13 Bolts, 2 Fixed Draws for Anchors
