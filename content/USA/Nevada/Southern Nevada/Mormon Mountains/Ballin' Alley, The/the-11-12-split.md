# Description
Height dependent beta in some sections of this route dictated a bit of a slash grade with this one. Steeper than it looks (per usual), the line follows tiered roof sections up and right. No obvious crux really, just sustained overhanging climbing.# Location
Just to the left of the main cave, after "Captain Headpin" and the Project route.# Protection
7 Bolts, 2 Fixed draws for Anchors
