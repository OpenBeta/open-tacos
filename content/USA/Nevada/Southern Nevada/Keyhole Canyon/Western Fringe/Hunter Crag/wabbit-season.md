# Description
From a small pocket in the wash, behind some large boulders, follow a seam up through fractured rock. After about 15’ the rock gets better and the seam widens into a crack with a bush in it. Be kind to the bush, it’s easy to climb past it, and belay with gear at the top. This crack is just to the right of a small dihedral.# Location
The start is hidden behind some large boulders at the right end of the crag, just before a step in the wash.# Protection
Stoppers, brass nuts, & cams up to 3”.
