# Description
This climb is the left of the two offwidths on the upper tier and starts from the ledge that bisects the cliff. Climb a hand and fist crack that leads into a squeeze chimney. Small cracks at the back of the chimney provide plenty of gear for the first half and the horizontal crack near the top takes hand-size cams. Above this it’s wide gear or run it out. Belay with gear.Descent: If you have all of your stuff it’s easier to scramble down to the base of the cliff from the saddle on the north side of the crag. To get back to the ledge at the base of the climb take the ridge south for 150’ to the last and largest gray buttress. Scramble down the north side of the buttress on fourth class terrain to the end of the long ledge or continue a few more feet to reach the base of the cliff.# Location
The left of the two obvious chimneys on the upper tier in the center of the crag. Gain the ledge from the south end of the crag on 4th class terrain and traverse left to reach the base.# Protection
Single set of cams to 4", set of stoppers, plus one or two pieces in the 12-16" range (#4 BigBro is barely big enough).
