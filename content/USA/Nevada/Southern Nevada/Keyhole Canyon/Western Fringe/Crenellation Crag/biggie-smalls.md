# Description
Same start as Fatboy Slim. Around 15’ up step right onto the face under the right offwidth where after 6’ of steep face the chimney is gained. The chimney gets easier as you ascend. Seams below the chimney and small cracks at the back of it provide ample opportunity for protection.Belay with gear.Descent: If you have all of your stuff it’s easier to scramble down to the base of the cliff from the saddle on the north side of the crag. To get back to the ledge at the base of the climb take the ridge south for 150’ to the last and largest gray buttress. Scramble down the north side of the buttress on fourth class terrain to the end of the long ledge or continue a few more feet to reach the base of the cliff.# Location
The right of the two obvious chimneys on the upper tier in the center of the crag. Gain the ledge from the south end of the crag on 4th class terrain and traverse left to reach the base.# Protection
Set of cams to 4" with doubles of 3/4" and less, stoppers, brass nuts.
