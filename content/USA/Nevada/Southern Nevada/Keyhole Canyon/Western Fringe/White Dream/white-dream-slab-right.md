# Description
Kind of a Choose Your Own Adventure route with a difficulty of 5.4 if you wind your way through the path of least resistance.Start at the lowest tongue of white rock on the wall. Walk up low-angle water polished slab to a ledge with a cleft at 40' and rope up here. Near the left end of the cleft, angling up and left, climb out the right side below a long bulge using the cracks at the under the bulge. Step right at the end of the bulge heading up and right past flakes and seams on easier ground to the corner forming the right edge of the cliff. Climb the wide crack left under the small roof and pull around the corner, follow the easy broken corner up a few feet to a largish belay stance before the corner steepens. Climb the corner for a few feet then cut left onto a flake/crack system and follow it to the top. Belay with gear. Walk right a short ways and down the steep but easy hillside south of White Dream Slab.# Location
