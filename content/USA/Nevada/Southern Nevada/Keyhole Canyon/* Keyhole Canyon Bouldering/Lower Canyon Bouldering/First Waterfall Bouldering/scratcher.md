# Description
Start sitting with low holds, make your way to sidepulls on your left, use some underclings to get over to a sloper on your left, then top out left.Short, challenging but easier once you figure out the beta. Rock is mostly smooth.# Location
Walk to the back of the canyon, right before the carved water chute/waterfall. The climb starts on the left side of the small cave before you turn the last corner.# Protection
Crash pad, so low a spotter is nice but not needed.
