# Description
Natural Selection climbs the unusually smooth wall on the north side of the canyon proper. The wall is split by two thin cracks; one moving up, right and back left and another moving left, right and left again- this is the line of Natural Selection. Thin crack climbing with glassy feet make this tall problem a formidable challenge.# Location
