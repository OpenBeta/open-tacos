# Description
Span the overhanging feature to start (this will be much harder, or potentially impossible, for shorter climbers). Use a good toe hook and lots of body tension to match the arete, hold the swing when releasing the toe and then top out straight up.For climbers who can't make the span, the problem can be started one move in (matched on the arete with a toe hook underneath).# Location
The overhanging feature on your right immediately before passing through the constriction.# Protection
