# Description
Start on the large, flat block underneath the overhang. Use any number of left sidepulls and some core strength to get your right hand out to a good edge. Throw your feet (or use some fancy, static footwork) to get a right heel hook and top out.The movement and blocky start underneath an overhang are reminiscent ofMothership Connectionin the Sad Boulders of Bishop, CA (hence the name).# Location
The overhanging feature on your right immediately before passing through the constriction.# Protection
