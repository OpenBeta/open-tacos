# Description
Stand start using the good right-hand rail and left-hand sloper. Hand-heel match on the rail to get off the ground, and work your way up the arete using compression beta and technical footwork to a delicate topout.Overall good landing except for the granite wall that comes very close to the climber near the top out. The polished granite can make the top out very sketchy until the moves are worked out. A good spotter with a spot pad is advised.A hard extension to this problem is possible by going lower on the dihedral.# Location
This problem encompasses the prominent dihedral in the cave perma-shaded by the Futurama Entrance Slab boulder.# Protection
2-3 pads
