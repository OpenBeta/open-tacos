# Description
This somewhat contrived problem climbs an obvious rounded protrusion on the south side of the canyon about 60 yards down from the smooth waterfall. A crouching start on a good start hold leads to slapping and compression moves straight up and over the bulging feature. The hardest moves are when firing up to the top-out jug. A very fine problem that is a nice change of pace from the Red Rock crimping.# Location
