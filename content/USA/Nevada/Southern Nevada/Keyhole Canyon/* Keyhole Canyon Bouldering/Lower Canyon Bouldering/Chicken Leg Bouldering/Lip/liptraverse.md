# Description
This lip traverse climbs the obvious table-like boulder about 25 yards south of the waterfall. Crouch start and heel hook your way right to the sharp arete at the end of the boulder. Be conscious of the boulder behind you if you fail to press out the mantle. Good movement on good rock with a fun top out make this good practice for harder lip problems like The Alexisizer at Kraft and Mr. Moran in Gateway Canyon.# Location
