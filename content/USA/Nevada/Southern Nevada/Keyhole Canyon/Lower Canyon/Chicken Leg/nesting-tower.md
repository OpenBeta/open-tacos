# Description
Climb the "tower" (this perspective can only be seen from the base) on the left side of the wall just before the Death Couloir. Start at the back of the large boulders on the right side. Climb the broken, easy left-leaning ramp until you can step right over not-too-loose blocks to the first bolt. Veering slightly left, follow a series of boulder move steps past three more bolts and some gear. A #1 camalot in a pocket on the face protects the exposed moves to the last bolt. Like the climbs to either side, this climb protects like shit for the first 30ish feet due to the blocky nature.# Location
The left side of Chicken Leg Area just before the Death Couloir.# Protection
Cams & nuts up to 1.5", four bolts.
