# Description
Start on the left side of the Chicken Leg Wall, next to the Death Couloir, behind the last large boulder where it almost touches the cliff. Climb up 30ish feet of easy blocky terrain without protection to a dark crack. The rest of the route protects well. Climb the crack to a ledge, step left around the corner and up another crack.# Location
