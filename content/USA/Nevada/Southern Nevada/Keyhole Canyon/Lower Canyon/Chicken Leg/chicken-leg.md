# Description
Climb the obvious crack system to the right side on the cleanest facet of this cliff. There are two starts: climb the up the left side of the drumstick at 5.9, or a couple feet left is a more direct start on a thinner crack, 10b. The crack splits again at the top, both 5.8ish. Anchor in the large blocks on top that appear poised to slip off in a manner that won't give gravity the advantage.# Location
The main Crack on the right side of the wall.# Protection
Up to 2.5"
