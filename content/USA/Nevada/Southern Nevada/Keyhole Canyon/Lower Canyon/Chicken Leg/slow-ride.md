# Description
Scramble straight up past the A Might Fright access past one bolt, aiming for a stepped dihedral with a cat claw bush growing out of it (the largest dihedral in a series of small dihedrals up high). The gear before the bolt 30' up is sketchy behind semi-detached blocks that are comfortable to climb but may or may not hold a fall.# Location
Center route on the left half of the Chicken Leg Area.# Protection
Up to 2", one bolt.
