# Description
Start under a right-facing dihedral. Climb rotten rock that gets better in a few feet to a bolt, step up and reach left to clip another bolt. Continue left past this onto the big column that forms the left side of the dihedral. Face moves lead up and left to the next crack, bypass a roof here then step right to the center of the column and up the middle to the top. Belay with gear in good rock. Descent: Scramble a few feet back towards the wash and rappel from the large slung horn at the top of Involuntary Roadkill.# Location
A couple hundred feet up the Death Couloir the rock on the right becomes less broken and the cliffs more consistent.  A low irregular roof section begins at large right-facing dihedral, the climb starts from a manicured flat area under the dihedral.# Protection
Three bolts, gear up to 3".
