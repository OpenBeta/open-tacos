# Description
Start under a large right-facing dihedral, climb past one bolt into the base of the dihedral where the rock gets better. A run-out section on easier rock leads up to a roof with an irregular finger crack. Follow this out left, crux, then straight up where the crack gets wider. Belay from a large slung horn with a nice stance where the crack ends at a ledge.# Location
A couple hundred feet up the Death Couloir the rock on the right becomes less broken and the cliffs more consistent. A low irregular roof section begins at large right-facing dihedral, the climb starts from a manicured flat area under the dihedral.# Protection
One bolt, gear to 3".
