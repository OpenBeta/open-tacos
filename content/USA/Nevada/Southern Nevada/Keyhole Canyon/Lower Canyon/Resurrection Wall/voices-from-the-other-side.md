# Description
Start under a low roof on the right side in a crack with some loose rock. A few feet up skirt left along the lip of the roof and mantle on to a small stance. From here, take small seams up and slightly right to finish on a blunt arete with lesser quality rock. Belay from a good ledge with only somewhat manky gear in a short section of rotten incut horizontal crack that takes a couple hand-size and one 4-5” cams. It’s pretty good but is also the kind of belay that makes one feel like sitting back and digging both heels in to back it up. To descend, hike up the ledge and over the top of the ridge to reach the very back of the Death Couloir before going down.# Location
This climb is on the right side a couple hundred feet up the Death Coulior, just before it bends left.# Protection
Cams up to 4-5" with extra small/micro sizes, brass nuts, stoppers.
