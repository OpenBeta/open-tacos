# Description
Climb small, polished foot holds that become increasingly more incipient up and right past a bolt and into the wide, shallow groove that marks the right side of Snake Eyes Wall. Follow this till it ends on the left edge of the Demonstrator ledge. The commitment comes just before the bolt, the crux just after and the rest is 5.9 or less. Descend by walking off the Demonstrator ledge to the right.# Location
The right most climb on the Snake Eyes Wall.# Protection
One bolt, small cams and nuts.
