# Description
Climb the boulder problem start done by George a few years earlier (exits down left from the high end of the shallow ramp) and step up and right to the first bolt 30 or so feet off the ground. Medium quality brass nuts or Lowballs can be found to protect the move to the bolt. Two more bolts lead up through the first roof and the crux. Jog right as the roof is pulled and stand up to one more bolt. Climb up and left around the second roof finishing straight up on a seam with a sleeper 10a exit move 15' above the last bolt/worthwile protection. Variation: At the last bolt, climb up to the second roof and follow it out right, 5.10a, finishing on the top of Dinosaur Rib. This top out protects well with 1" and smaller cams.# Location
On a seam just right of center on the Snake Eyes Wall, where the wall kicks up out of the wash.# Protection
Four bolts, 1"cams to brass nuts. 3/4-1" cams can be placed above the first roof, before the fourth bolt.
