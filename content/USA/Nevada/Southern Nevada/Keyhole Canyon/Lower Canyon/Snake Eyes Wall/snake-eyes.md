# Description
Climb the boulder problem start until the seam widens into a crack and straight up over the roof. The first opportunity for protection is at about 20' and protects well the rest of the way. The boulder problem exit is the ramp to the left about 15' up. By standing in the right spot, the snake eyes can be seen through the roof.# Location
In the center of the wall, Snake Eyes is the most obvious crack that almost makes it down to the wash.# Protection
1/2" to 3"
