Stand up right onto a large ledge, take more small seams to the arete then traverse right under a roof past a bolt and finish on a hand crack at the end of the roof. Belay with gear, walk off descent- left goes all the way to the wash with a short section of 4th class, right and up goes to the top of the Chuckwalla Couloir and is 3rd class down this.# Location
