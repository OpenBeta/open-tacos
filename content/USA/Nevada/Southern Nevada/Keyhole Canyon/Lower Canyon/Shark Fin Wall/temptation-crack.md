# Description
3-4' to the right of the Wildlife Route is a tips to finger crack and it's a contrivance not to use both cracks. Start under the finger crack (the corner to the right of the wide crack of Fallout Shelter) on slightly overhanging broken rock and climb to the right end of the fractured ledge (no pro until the ledge). Avoiding the easily reachable dihedral, face climb to the skinny crack and follow it to the top. Belay with gear, walk off descent- left goes all the way to the wash with a short section of 4th class, right and up goes to the top of the Chuckwalla Couloir and is 3rd class down this.# Location
The skinny straight crack a of couple feet right of the Wildlife Route, faces the wash.# Protection
