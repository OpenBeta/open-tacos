# Description
Climb the nice looking grey face just to the right of the overhangs past two 1/4" split-pin bolts to the top. Stoppers or a tricam can be finagled into the pockets above the last bolt. This is a serious route more reliably treated as a tall boulder problem or TR. A fall from just before clipping the second bolt or from near the top will result in decking.# Location
The first route on the right side of the gully that divides the South Front Slabs.# Protection
Two old 1/4" bolts, stacked stoppers or tricams
