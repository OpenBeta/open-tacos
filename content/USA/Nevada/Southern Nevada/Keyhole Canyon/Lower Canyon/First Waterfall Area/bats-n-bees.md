# Description
Start at the apex of the cave and follow a seam up and right under a tiny roof past a button head rivet until it ends at a rest ledge. Follow an intermittent crack up and right from the ledge to pull the last overhang, then continue straight up through a broken crack. Belay on the ridge with gear.# Location
On the left side of the wash at a cave under Rats-n-Bees. A Button head rivet near the lip of the cave marks the start (this was used by George as he established the first half of the route on roped solo).# Protection
Hooks, peckers, RURPs, brass nuts & cams from micro to 2".
