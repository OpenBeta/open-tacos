# Description
Start on the 5.10 boulder problem dyke, or step up from the side, onto the fin of rock that juts out from the right side of the First Waterfall. Clip a bolt, stand up past the second bolt (maybe a long reach for shorter folk) and the crux. Mantel up the next section to a hidden bolt, up face moves protected by small TCUs, then angle left past a bulge to easier climbing with no gear and the two bolt belay or summit the tower and belay with adequate but manky gear. Descend by rapping from the bolts or hike off/down climb to the south.# Location
On the small tower right of the First Waterfall.# Protection
Three bolts, cams- TCUs to 2".
