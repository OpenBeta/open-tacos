# Description
To the right of the waterfall, about 10 feet, at the intersection of two obscure dikes, climb up past two bolts to gain the left of the two wide dihedrals and follow this up, and right at the top, until it ends on a ledge partway up Quehoe's Tower. This route joins Bennet A. Lyberger half way up and finishes in the same dihedral and belay. Descend by going to the right side of this ledge and down climbing the easy shallow dihedral or scrambling up and around the tower to rappel the First Waterfall.# Location
To the right of the first water fall, about 12 feet. On the face to the right of the fin of rock that sticks out into the wash just before the First Waterfall.# Protection
Two bolts, gear up to 2"
