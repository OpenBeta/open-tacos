# Description
Climb tuffa-like flowstone on the right side of dark, shallow recess at the base of the cliff to gain a steep ramp. Follow the ramp to the Rats-n-Bees anchors. Gear can be had but it's in semidetached blocks that are OK to climb on but unreliable for gear. Best treated as a solo.# Location
Just left of the polished grey overhang in front of the waterfall.# Protection
Sketchy, up to 2"
