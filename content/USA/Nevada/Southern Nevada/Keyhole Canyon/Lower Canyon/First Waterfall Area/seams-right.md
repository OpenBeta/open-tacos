# Description
Aid the seam in the funnel on the right side of the First Waterfall. Bat hooks, bird beaks, shallow rurps, and bashies lead up to a 1/4" button head rivet in the face. Continue up a few feet and follow the seam at the base of the slight headwall to the right, up the next steep section, and a couple free climbing moves lead to the two bolt belay on the north side of Quehoe's Tower. Rappel from here to descend. The rivet is the first bit of pro that would hold a fall.# Location
On the right side of the First Waterfall.# Protection
Bat hooks x2, sky hooks x2, 2-3 bird beaks or peckers, small copperheads, hammer, brass offsets, cams- micro TCUs to 2".
