# Description
Step up through the polished corner under the start of the crack. Follow the crack through the roof, the crux is pulling the lip, to easy ground above and belay at the ledge for Common Wealth with 2-3” cams or lasso with a cordelette. This climb has good pro but there’s a possibility to hit the jutting slab/kid slide if the crux is blown, so place well and bring an attentive belayer.From the belay ledge descend by down climbing the easy shallow dihedral to the right or scrambling up and around the tower to either rappel the First Waterfall or from the anchors on Quehoe’s Tower (reached from the backside via an airy one move traverse).# Location
The first steep route on the right side of The First Waterfall cul-de-sac.# Protection
Cams up to 2", stoppers, plus a couple 2-3" cams or a cordelette for the belay.
