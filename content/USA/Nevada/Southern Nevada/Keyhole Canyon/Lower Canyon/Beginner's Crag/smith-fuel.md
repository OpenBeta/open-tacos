# Description
Climb slab and cracks in the broken left-facing corner. Its possible to stay in the corner all the way to the top and has been led but it gets looser, harder (5.9ish), more run-out, and more inviting to merge left. Scramble up and right on the descent ledge to reach the couloir.# Location
Start in the corner on the right side of the flat bit of land just out of the wash.# Protection
Cams- micro to 3", stoppers, brass nuts.
