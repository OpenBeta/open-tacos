# Description
Scramble up easy slab for 20' to a stance at the base of the steep wall, to the right of a small roof and belay from here. Climb the steep face past the first bolt to small cracks and seams, this is the crux. Continue straight up, leap frogging horizontal cracks and three more bolts. Back up the last bolt with gear or go a little farther and use all gear to belay. Walk/scramble off up and left to reach the back of the big dihedral on the north side of Intelligence Test Wall. This down climb is mostly third class with some 5.2ish moves near the bottom.# Location
On the north end of Intelligence Test Wall just before the wall makes the corner to the big dihedral.# Protection
Four bolts, cams- TCUs to 1".
