Boulder up easy moves on the white rock a few feet and start on a flat spot next to a cat claw bush below the short dihedral. Mantle up once or twice to get into the dihedral and climb to the top, turn the corner onto the slab and continue up to ledges. This is a fun boulder problem sandwiched between scrambling.# Location
The short dihedral closest to the fence on the north facing short cliff that divides the left & right North Front Slabs# Protection
