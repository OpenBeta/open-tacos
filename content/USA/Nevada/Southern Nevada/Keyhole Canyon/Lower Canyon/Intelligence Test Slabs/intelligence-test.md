# Description
This is an excellent beginner climb and frequently soloed. Climb on jugs through a steep scalloped bulge to a ledge where two left-leaning cracks pinch off. Using the upper crack as a handrail, walk along the bottom crack until the upper crack kicks straight up at a small stance and follow it. When the crack ends step right onto the shallow buttress. Belay with gear. Walk/scramble off up and left to reach the back of the big dihedral on the north side of Intelligence Test Wall. This down climb is mostly third class with some 5.2ish moves near the bottom. There're other ways to descend but this way avoids the petroglyphs.# Location
Near the right end of Intelligence Test Wall from the low-angle slabs.# Protection
