# Description
Climb a water streak wrinkled with cracks past two overlaps. Continue on easier ledgy ground to a catclaw tree. Belay on the Tyrolean rappel bolts. To descend, rappel from these bolts (which will likely need new slings) or scramble up the gully to a ledge just below the lower anchors of the Tyrolean, left on the ledge to the Chuckwalla Couloir.# Location
On the Chuckwalla Wall a short ways out of the wash at the back of a low-angle slab.# Protection
Stoppers, cams up to 2".
