# Description
Same start as Mystery Route. Climb up 15' past a tiny fixed wire, to a small ramp that goes up and left. Pull a small bulge, crux, continue left a few more feet to reach small discontinuous cracks that go straight up right, belay on a large ledge. Descent: From the ledge, step right to join shallow steep gully under the Tyrollean anchors. Go down the gully to the Tyrollean rappel or up to the ledges left of the Tyrollean anchors. Take the ledges left to finish down the Chuckwalla Couloir.# Location
Center of the Chuckwalla Wall.# Protection
