# Description
Above the clean low-angle slab, aim for a hanging block to the right of a wide crack. Climb over the middle of the block, through the X made by seams, continue straight up above the block on more X seams to a left-leaning ridge. Follow the ridge a few feet to a nice flat ledge just above the tyrolean rappel bolts and belay with gear on the ledge or step down to the bolts. Descent: rappel from the bolts.# Location
Just to the right of the wide crack of Stephanie's Stomping Grounds, low on the right side of the Chuckwalla Wall.# Protection
Small wire, cams up to 2".
