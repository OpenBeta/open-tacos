# Description
Walk up the low-angle base to a short vertical section with a bolt. Climb straight up past the bolt on thin flakes and seams staying to the right of the small overhangs in the dark brown rock. Tiny wires and micro cams are the only pro after the bolt. Belay on a good ledge with gear. Descend by traversing right to the gully/ramp then 1) follow the ramp down to rappel bolts behind a catclaw bush, or 2) go up the ramp about 80' and traverse left to the Chuckwalla Couloir on the ledge system just below the tyrolean bolts, scramble back down the couloir.# Location
A short ways out of the wash is a clean, low-angle facet of rock that comes out of the talus at the base of Chuckwalla Wall. The route starts at the top left side of this feature.# Protection
One bolt, tiny wires and micro cams.
