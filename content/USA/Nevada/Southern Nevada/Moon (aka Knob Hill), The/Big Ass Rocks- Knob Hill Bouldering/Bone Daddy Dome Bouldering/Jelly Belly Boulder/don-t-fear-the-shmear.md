# Description
Height dependent. Stand start using the pocket and crimp mid face. Work up and left to the next pocket, following to the seam like dike. The height challenged may need to stack pads or jump start. Be weary of where you grab the dike on the top of the rock, some parts may be chossy *voice of experience*https://youtu.be/yvkqJXbQnRc# Location
This problem is on the south side of Jelly bean boulder, which is on the NW side of "Bone Daddy Dome". Approach from the road that heads west from "Camp 4".# Protection
One or two pads. Soft ground.
