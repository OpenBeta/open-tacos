# Description
Step up on to the small block on the underside of the left side of the boulder. Crimp grip on the obvious edge and pull yourself up and quickly grab for a higher open grip hold. bring your feet from the friction smears up to the line that you were just crimping on. From there pull yourself to the top. It is a little difficult to downclimb so i just jumped from the top of the boulder to the ledge slightly behind and below it.# Location
Across the campsite from Baby Dyno.# Protection
