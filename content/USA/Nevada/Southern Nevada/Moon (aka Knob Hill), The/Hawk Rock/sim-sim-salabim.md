# Description
Climb up a seam to the largest alcove, aid or make super hard moves for a few feet out the top then jog left on easier grounds to reach a cluster of broken right leaning cracks and finish on these. A two bolt belay station is just out of sight from the left side of the summit ledge. Rap from here or walk off right to descend.# Location
The center of the east face of Hawk Rock.# Protection
7 bolts, brass nuts, cams up to 2".
