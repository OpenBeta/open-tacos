# Description
A nice chimney on the south end of Split Rock, the namesake of the area. Most start the chimney on the south side where its a bit of a squeeze to step up into but the crack goes all the way through and it can be started on the north side as well. Once inside the chimney there are several ways to reach the top with some being harder than 5.8. Generally the center is easiest.# Location
On the south face of Split Rock on the right end.# Protection
Commitment. Or it can always be top roped.
