# Description
From the base of an obvious crack, step right onto the face, clip a bolt and continue up past two more bolts and small seams to a ledge at the top. Belay with two bolts, walk off the backside to descend. Leaving rappel biners or slings is like a target magnet to many of the shooting enthusiasts that visit the area. It got the name from an incident earlier in the day when Robert's dog got caught and injured in a leg trap.# Location
On the south face of Split Rock, left a few feet from the cave that passes through.# Protection
Three bolt, micro-small TCUs.
