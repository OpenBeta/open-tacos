# Description
Climb a flake until it ends, then step out left onto a dyke. Follow the dyke away from your protection towards easier climbing and ground fall potential. The climb ends at a rusted one-bolt belay under the big roof. The name came from all of the bones of little critters (discards from the raptor perch above) found in the cracks and edges by the first accent party.# Location
Near the center of the west face of Bone Daddy Dome under a long roof.# Protection
Cams up to 2".
