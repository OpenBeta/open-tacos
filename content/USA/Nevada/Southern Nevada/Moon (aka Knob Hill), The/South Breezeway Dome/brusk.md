# Description
A short, sweet, slightly past vertical crack formed by a detached toe of the dome. Starts with hands and gets wider from there. Two bolts serve for the belay for this climb and the climb on the backside of this crack. Don't rap as the bolts are just for belaying and far from the edge. Descend by going north a few feet, hop over to the west side and down the stepped narrow ledge.# Location
On the south crest of the dome halfway up on the east side. Go all the way to the south end of the dome and 3rd class back north along the crest and ledges.# Protection
Cams 2-5".
