# Description
Same start as Dustin the Wind. Face climb past a bolt to a small stance with TCU placements then up the shallow outside corner past more bolts to a crack. Continue up and right past the crack to a seam below a dyke, then follow the dyke through the head wall. Bring a #2 or #3 cam to protect the last moves or run it out to a two bolt belay. To descend, go to the rap station on the west side at the top of Vertical Valium then follow the Breezeway back to the base.# Location
Start from the lowest point on the east face.# Protection
8 bolts, cams- TCUs up to 3".
