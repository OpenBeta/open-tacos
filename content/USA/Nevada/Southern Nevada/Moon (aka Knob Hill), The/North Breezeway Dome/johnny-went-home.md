# Description
Four bolts protect the face, 5.9, up to a tiny dihedral that leads to the ledge at the top of the first pitch of Highlander Roof. Continue on Highlander Roof through the wide crack, 5.8, to the top of the dome. Belay with gear. To descend, 1) go 40' to the north end of the dome and rappel from the belay station of Three Dicks on a Dyke back down the east side (you might need a leaver sling), or 2) go to the rap station on the west side at the top of Vertical Valium then follow the Breezeway back to the base.# Location
To reach this, hike/scramble around the north end of Hawk Rock and then back south to the end of the corridor formed between Hawk Rock and North Breezeway Dome.# Protection
Four bolts, Cams- TCUs up to 4".
