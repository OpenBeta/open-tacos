# Description
This ridge is best done south to north and is about three miles long. The route follows the ridge the entire way. I recommend getting dropped off and arrange for a pickup at Rail Road Pass Casino or bring two cars, leaving a second car at the Pass.# Location
From the US93/95 junction go south on U95 for three miles (two from the new freeway) to Spring Canyon Rd. Turn right on this dirt road and follow it past the gravel pits for two miles to the foot of the mt.# Protection
Good shoes, sunhat.
