# Description
There is only one bolt remaining about halfway up the route and some evidence of other removed bolts (so if you are planning on sport climbing this be prepared for some runout right off the ground). You could try setting up a natural anchor for a top rope if you don't think that a singular bolt is safe enough. There are some obvious chalk marks from climbers and boulderers about 8 to 10 feet off the ground.# Location
Furthest route to the right at Rattlesnake Crag (to the right of "Rattlesnake Roof")# Protection
One bolt, TR possibly if you have webbing and trust chossy rock to hold your weight.
