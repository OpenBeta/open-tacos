# Description
A short Sport/Trad/Toprope route. There are only a couple of bolted hangers on the route as well as one at the top so it will be PG13 if you are sport climbing as the first bolt is pretty high off the deck. If you were to trad climb it you could place pro in the obvious crack a few feet to the right of where the bolted line is. It is the only route with an anchor at the top that I could find. Beware, there are really solid sections of rock but there are also interspersed areas of chossy and crumbly rock (just like every other route here).# Location
Furthest left route at Rattlesnake Crag.# Protection
2 bolted hangers, one top hanger anchor, trad gear (not sure what sizes as I only sport climb) if you are climbing the crack.
