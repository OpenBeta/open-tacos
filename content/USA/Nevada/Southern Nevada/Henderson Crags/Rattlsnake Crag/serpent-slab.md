# Description
A short Sport/Trad route. There are only a couple of bolted hangers on the route so it will be PG13 if you are sport climbing as the first bolt is nearly halfway up the route. If you were to trad climb it you could place pro in the obvious crack a few feet to the right of where the bolted line is. Fortunately this route is not as chossy as some of the other climbing here.# Location
A short ways down the ridge on the right of "Crotalus Crack".# Protection
2 bolted hangers, trad gear (not sure what sizes as I only sport climb) if you are climbing the crack.
