# Description
Match on the low jug. Make a high hand move to a good sloper. Plenty of space and area to smear to make way up to the top. The rock surface crumbles pretty easily when using feet and smearing.# Location
This problem is at the main cluster of boulders off the dirt road. The boulder sits on the backside of the west side of the cluster before the area drops deep into the gully. The actual problem faces south.35.6460, -115.2692# Protection
