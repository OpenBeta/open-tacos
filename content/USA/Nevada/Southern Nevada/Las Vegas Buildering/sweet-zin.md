# Description
Start on good jugs at the base of the bell tower, climb about 20 feet and then traverse left to the first major balcony or traverse higher and get on top of the balcony roof. Rest up a bit and tackle the crux (two uncharacteristically difficult moves involving a bad crimp and a chossy pinch) pulling over the roof to the left at the base of the final section of facade to the top. The end is easy V1-V2 climbing for about another 20 feet until you mantle over to a small balcony just below the bell. You cannot climb any further as the stone facade ends at this point. Rappel if you brought a rope or down climb... or fall.# Location
The obvious bell tower connected to the abandoned casino.# Protection
