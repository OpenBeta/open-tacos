# Description
Great route with lots of varied movement and features. A tricky slab gets your attention off the ground (stick clip recommended). Enjoy the tufa and face climbing before a boulder problem traverse, and another boulder guarding the chains.A hold near the top of the route can be wet, but it can be avoided if you have the right beta.# Location
Starts to the right of Waste Not Want Not on the same tricky slab. Climbs past three bolts to a small cave feature. Continue up above the small cave, using the tufa out right before working left across the face to a short overhung dihedral section. From here, traverse right through the overhanging face past 3 bolts to the anchor. Long draw recommended before the traverse.# Protection
About 13? bolts + chains
