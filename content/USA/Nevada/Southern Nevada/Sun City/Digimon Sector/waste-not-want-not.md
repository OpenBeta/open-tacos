Techy climbing on great pink limestone.# Location
First route to the right of the Scrum Felcher (10c) corner. Starts on a slab up to a short tufa, then pulls onto the vertical pink face with crimps and techy movement. Turns slabby at the top where you can clip the chains, or continue up the 13- extension, MACMFR (Meat and Cheese Memorial Face Route) for 5 more bolts.# Protection
10 bolts + chains
