This one's got a little bit of everything. After climbing the right-angling slabby ramp, follow the path of least resistance past tufas and up the dark colored dihedral.# Location
Slampiece is the second route to the right of Happy Ending, and is one route left of Black Beauty. Locate the obvious right-angling ramp from bolts 1 to 3.# Protection
