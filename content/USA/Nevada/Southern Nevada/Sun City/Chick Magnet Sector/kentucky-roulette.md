# Description
Nice route featuring some big moves between good pockets.Starts on a vertical face and leads into some fun climbing on edges and pockets. Power into an undercling and clip the fixed draw. Sort out the crux and enjoy sharp blue stone to the top.# Location
Just right of the big notched roof on the Chick Magnet Wall. Can't miss the white fixed chain draw.# Protection
8 bolts. One fixed. Chains.
