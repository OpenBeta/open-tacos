# Description
Good route that starts on some junky slab, pulls a mini-roof, and features some quality climbing through a bulge on black and orange rock. Higher quality than the surrounding routes. Fun movement through the bulge.# Location
Just left of Chick Magnet. Pulls the same mini-roof. Look for black and orange rock through a bulge.# Protection
9 bolts. Chains.
