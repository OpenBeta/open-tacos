# Description
The Sauna Cave is a quarter mile upriver and this approach almost always requires some swimming or wading.Where the hot springs meets the river, a low bank of bedrock juts out from the north side of Gold Strike Canyon. Start traversing now for bonus moves, or get on top and walk to the other side where eventually you'll end up making some climbing moves to get back to the water. Commit to getting wet now or keep traversing. After a short distance, the climbing and water become one when an alcove weeping with water and ferns is reached. Continue along the base of the cliff or go a little ways out to a sandbar. If you reach the Nevada gravel dumps, then you've gone just a bit too far.The river level changes by several feet a couple times a day as water is released from the dam. What was walkable might be under water in just a few minutes or vice versa.# Location
At the mouth of Gold Strike Canyon, head upriver along the cliff.# Protection
Self, swimming or wading in frigid water.
