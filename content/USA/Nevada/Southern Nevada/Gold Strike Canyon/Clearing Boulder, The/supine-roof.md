# Description
Start two hands on the lowest jug with a fun invert left toe hook and right foot lower down. Do some fun moves on good holds and finish at the lip, to the right of the slopey pocket. Hardest part is not dabbing, though the deadpoint to the pinch/3 finger edge is pretty hard too. Avoid grabbing the lip early, if you do, it is easier.# Location
So far the only problem on The Clearing Boulder.# Protection
A pad or two.
