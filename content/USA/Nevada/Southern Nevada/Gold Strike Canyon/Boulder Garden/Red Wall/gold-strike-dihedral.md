# Description
Begin under the dihedral. The first 25' is unprotected climbing on a less than vertical slab coated with an excellent example of slip fault glazing. A bulge on the upper half of the dihedral and the top gets a little loose but is also easier. Plan on leaving slings to rap down.# Location
This is a wide dihedral on the north side of the wash in beautiful red rock above the Boulder Garden.# Protection
Cams up to 3" and a set of nuts.
