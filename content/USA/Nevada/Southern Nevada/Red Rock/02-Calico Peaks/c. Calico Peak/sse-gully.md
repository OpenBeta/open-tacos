# Description
Closest descent gully to the South Ridge routes.Perhaps a couple of low-5th-class moves.From the Frostie Shack Pass, scramble up steep-ish NNW into a narrow gully and up this to its top, around (N36.1587 W115.4376).To reach the Calico South Viewpoint (N36.1585 W115.4380), continue gentler NW to around (N36.1591 W115.4383), then sharp Left turn and South on mostly-gentle rock to the viewpoint.# Location
See the routeSouthEast Gullyfor how to reach the Frostie Shack Pass (N36.1581 W115.4368) which has some nice shade -- on a hot sunny day, step inside for refreshing drink (but bring your own ice).- - >See on this Photo# Protection
