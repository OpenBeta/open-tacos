Scramble (some 4th class moves, or at least sustained exposed 3rd class) 200 ft NW through this to gentler ground (N36.1592 W115.4376).From here a nice objective is around SW about 200 ft to the Calico South Viewpoint (N36.1585 W115.4380)Or to reach one of the Calico Peak summits, go about 150 ft NW, then 300 ft N with some scrambling.descent:Return the same way.# Location
