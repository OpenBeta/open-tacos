# Description
Big summit view (including the city of Las Vegas) with some nice hiking terrain past the biggest seasonal-pond (tinaja) in the Calicos. Finish with some thoughtful scrambling to the summit - (but the pond and most of the best views can be obtained without the summit scramble).Perhaps there's some way to get to the top while keeping the difficulty at the 3rd class level, but it's likely quicker and perhaps more fun (and safer?) if plan on doing some 4th class sequences.. . (some say the WSW face route gets to the summit shorter and with easier climbing).details:There's several different variations that work. Find your own way as best you can, and backtrack as needed.Here's my memory of what I did ...From the rock outcrop (N36.1608 W115.4378) by Calico / Tank Pass, up NE about 70 ft (perhaps a nicer view is a bit to the right). Next a bit NW perhaps 30 ft, then again NE another 130 ft, and N about 300 ft to the summit.More photos with different details onSummitPost.org.descent:Return the same way.# Location
From Sandstone Quarry parking (GPS lat long approx N36.1622 W115.4502) on the Red Rock Scenic Loop road, hike on the Calico Tanks trail (unmarked) for 0.4 mile (650 meters) at first N, then NE, then E - (where the Turtlehead Peak trail goes left, continue on the Right following the Calico Tanks trail). Around (N36.1666 W115.4481) the trail curves more right and climbs 0.7 mile / 1.1 km SouthEast, rougher with more rocks and zig-zags, to reach the Calico/Tank Pass (approx N36.1608 W115.4380). Just at the pass is a higher rock with a view to Las Vegas. Might be a better view a short ways up the SSW face climbing route, but if some members of the party are tired, this outcrop serves as a nice "top" -- if did not quit already at the sight of the bigtinajapond (N36.1612 W115.4381) about 200 ft NW below and before the Pass.. . It also it possible to start from Calico Basin parking (outside the Scenic Loop road), but this is more difficult climbing, or much longer, or both.# Protection
No fixed hardware for anchor or intermediate protection.Protection for Trad leading is unknown. Most people do it without a rope.
