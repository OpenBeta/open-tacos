# Description
Some interesting scrambling up to remarkably-shaped big rock.A way to reach the summit from the South without needing to cross a chasm with a more difficult exposed traverse.Perhaps useful as a Descent route if can find the top, but the Walrus tower (GPS lat long approx N36.15534 W115.4330) is not so easy to recognize from the top).We started exploring it hoping the lower section would get us to some interesting different style of climbing to one side of the other, but that didn't work out, so went back into the gully and finished up that, which was nice enough.Perhaps all could be done at 3rd class, but we did some 4th class moves to explore to the sides, so cannot verify that. It's at leastthoughtful3rd class.Before reaching the dramatically-overhanging Walrus tower, exit from the gully up Left (NNW) to the summit ridge, then NW up to the summit of Red Book Point.. .  An interesting side-trip near the top of Walrus Gully is to exit from the gully to climber's right (E) with a class 5 move that is easily spotted and is not exposed (make sure you can reverse it).  Now go to the top of the Walrus and explore the beautiful exposed, easy 4th class scrambling along the ridge, SE and S, then retrace back to the starting point by the base of the overhanging tower.Near the top of Walrus Gully (just before reaching the base of the overhanging tower) exit to the Left (NNW) and up to the summit ridge, then NW up to the small rock top of Red Book Point.descent: Unless you're sure you can succeed with something else, plan to reverse your ascent route.warning: Many loose rocks and weak breakable hand- and foot-holds on and around this route - (even when the rock plenty dry). The rock becomes especially weak for a couple of days after significant rain or snow, so holds are even more likely to break off.# Location
Bottom of gully around GPS latitude latitude approx (N36.1537 W115.4331), about 240 ft WSW below the Stairmaster Pass (a.k.a. South Pass).Shortest way to reach it from the west side is from the 2nd Pull-Out parking on the Red Rock Scenic Loop road. First go down into the main canyon generally N about 1000 ft to a flat area just before the entrance to The Black Corridor. Around (N36.1549 W115.4366) turn sharp Right, and go up a side canyon ESE about 1000 ft and see obvious gully going up left.Coming from the southeast in Calico Basin, could start from Red Springs parking, hike + scramble up roughly NW about 0.8 mile to the Stairmaster Pass (a.k.a. South Pass) - (N36.1534 W115.4323), then over down the other side a short ways (200 ft) to reach the bottom of the Walrus gully.# Protection
