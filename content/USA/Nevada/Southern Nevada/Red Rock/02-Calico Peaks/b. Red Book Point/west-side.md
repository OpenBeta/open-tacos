# Description
We have not done this route, but it's mentioned in at least one guidebook, and we met two parties on it near the summit.Likely useful at least as a descent route.- - > If you've done this route or know more about it, please post a Comment (below), or make an "Improve the Page" (with the link above).difficulty? So far we're calling it class 4 difficulty (to be conservative since we have not actually attempted it) -- but other sources say it's only class 3.route:? after exiting right from partway up the approach gully, scramble more or less ESE up and across the West face ?. . (Total about +600 vertical feet over 0.5 mile distance).More photos and details, see the Branch Whitney print guidebook,Hiking Las Vegas, around page 78?, route named something like ? "Calico Hills II Scrambling"?descent: Return the same way.warning: Many loose rocks and weak breakable hand- and foot-holds on and around this route - (even when the rock plenty dry). The rock becomes especially weak for a couple of days after significant rain or snow, so holds are even more likely to break off.# Location
. . (Might help tofind "rbp" on themap).From the "Second Pull-Out" parking (N36.1518 W115.4374) on the Red River Scenic Loop road, hike about 300 ft N on trail descending, at junction sharp Right down 130 ft E into wash. Next about 300 ft N without obvious trail, along left (W) side of wash, and NNE 250ft downward into center of wash (N36.1549 W115.4365). Into long uphill with some scrambling sections and sometimes vegetation to avoid, would be about 1000 ft N to reach the "Middle Pass" ...But about 400 ft before reaching the top of the gully, around (N36.1569 W115.4367) exit Right and start scrambling roughly ESE.# Protection
