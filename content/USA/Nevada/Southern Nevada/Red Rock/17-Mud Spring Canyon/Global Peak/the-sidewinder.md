# Description
This appealing corner, the most conspicuous on the north face, is a little brushy and occasionally loose, but it's still a worthy route. The left facing, right leaning feature is easy to identify, and the crux might be turning the roof about half way up. Or, it might be the complex first pitch. Some more traffic would improve some lichenous sections.# Location
It sits right of Chuckwalla on the remote northeast  face of Global Peak. It is the obvious left facing corner that leans right.  Follow the directions for the approach from Black Velvet parking as described in the Handren guide, or here on MP.# Protection
A standard rack with cams to 3" will work.
