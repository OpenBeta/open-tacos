# Description
Fingers in the Honeypot is a line that, in my opinion, is undeserving of the recommendation found in Red Rocks - A Climber's Guide II. The line is squeezed between two much better climbs, has some inexplicably unprotected stretches of climbing, is much harder than it's given rating, and has much hollow rock on the upper two thirds of the route.Begin by climbing past 5 tightly-spaced bolts. Thin. Not much to work with here. Above this, the bolts end in favor of sporadic and sketchy RP placements. More insecure, thin climbing leads to easier climbing that wanders back and forth up crunchy features before the route finally joins the upper few bolts of Man of the People.# Location
# Protection
A light rack, but include RP's and perhaps check this thing out on TR first?
