# Description
The Schwa is one of the few members of Red Rock Canyon's exclusive splitter crack club.  This club includes the likes of The Fox, Atman, Yin Yang, Red Zinger, and Chrysler Crack amongst a few others.The Schwa itself feels a lot like The Fox.  The second pitch of the route starts with hands and just gets bigger as you go.The best way to climb this route is to break it into two pitches.  There are a few ways to approach the main crack.  The left side is somewhat difficult, whereas the right side is somewhat brushy.  The best way up is up to you.The second pitch is the main event.  Climb up the central crack as it goes from tight jams to hand-stacks.  There is a diving board ledge in the middle of the second pitch where you can shake-out and relax before committing to the forty-foot off-width you'll climb to obtain the top.Two sixty-meter ropes will get you to the ground.# Location
This is the central feature of the Schwa Area.  Look for the diving board to the left of a widening crack.# Protection
A normal Red Rock rack with at least two #3s and two #4s.
