# Description
This fun, long pitch of thin face climbing is located immediately left of the Schwalli corner. Mostly positive incuts separated by good rests is the name of the game; the crux being at about 1/3 height at a bolt that is slightly left of the line. There are some slightly crumbly holds here and there but they will undoubtedly continue to consolidate with ascents.# Location
# Protection
11 bolts and a full 70m rope is mandatory. With a shorter rope you could conceivably do two raps/lowers using the Schwalli anchor.
