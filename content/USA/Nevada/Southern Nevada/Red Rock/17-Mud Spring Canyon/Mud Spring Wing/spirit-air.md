# Description
This is the leftmost bolted pitch beginning from the Schwalli platform. It follows a spectacular sharp arete passing a difficult and wild crux at mid-height. A few loose (and one particularly crucial hold - a pillar on the arete at 2/3 height) demand careful cranking!# Location
# Protection
12 bolts. An 80m rope is required for TR'ing or lowering, otherwise rap with a 70, or rap/lower twice using the Schwalli anchor with anything shorter.
