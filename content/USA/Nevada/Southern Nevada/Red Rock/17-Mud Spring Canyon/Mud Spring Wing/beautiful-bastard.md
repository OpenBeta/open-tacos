# Description
# Location
# Protection
single rack to 4''. stoppers.  2-3 yellow alien size.  2-3 slings. (G rated protection level on this one)there is an old bolt at the top-out located about 12 ft. left of the route.  there is no way to back up this bolt.  i made an anchor below and clipped it loose to test the bolt and the bolt seems 'ok'. a proper station would be ideal.
