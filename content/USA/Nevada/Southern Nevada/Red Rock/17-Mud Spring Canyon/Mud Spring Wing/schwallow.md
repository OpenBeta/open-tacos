# Description
A nice moderate in an out-of-the-way location, quite well protected. Pull a couple of short bulges at the beginning (crux, #3 Camalot is nice but not essential), enjoy the steep corner, then trend up and right to the Hangman’s House anchor.# Location
This climb follows a shallow corner system on the next arete left of Gadger’s Edge (and also left of Hangman’s House, a very impressive steep corner with bolts visible on the underside of an overhang at the top). It’s pretty much the leftmost good rock on this section of the crag. Scramble up onto a ledge atop a block to start.Descent is via the bolts atop Hangman’s House, just to the right at the top. It’s quite awkward getting to this anchor and there isn’t really a stance, so probably best to lower.# Protection
Standard rack to #3 Camalot. Two-bolt top anchor.
