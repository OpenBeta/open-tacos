# Description
Gadgers Edge is a phenomenal route up the arete just left of The Long Riders' corner. Ramble up the deep, right facing corner (a #3 and/or #4 Camalot with long sling might be wise your first time) before stepping out of the corner to the left and up onto a pillar from which you can clip the first of six bolts. Several technical sequences lead to a good stance by the fourth bolt followed by a wild boulder problem crux at the fifth bolt (cold temps were helpful for me on this one, but regardless the falls are clean). Make the final clip and do one more move before gaining jugs and the anchor of The Long Riders.# Location
# Protection
6 bolts. Optional #3/#4 Camalots with long slings.
