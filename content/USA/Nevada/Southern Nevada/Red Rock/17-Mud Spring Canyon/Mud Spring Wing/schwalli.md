# Description
A beautiful and interesting climb, Schwalli ascends the impressive looking corner above the ledge left of the Schwa Area. Despite looking fairly wide and intimidating, the crack is varied and abundant face holds keep you out of the crack for most of the climb.A single 60m rope will suffice, but if you're planning on doing anything on the left wall (Man of the People, Spirit Air, etc), bring a 70m rope and plenty of draws.# Location
4th class up to a rappel tree from a chossy looking platform right of the big roof. From there, head up and right across an exposed slab to the belay ledge.# Protection
Doubles from a #1 camalot to a #4 camalot will protect it nicely. A third #3 would give the 5.9 leader at their limit peace of mind.
