# Description
Impact Event shares the start with Decline of Man (12b) and then breaks right following the big holds left of the arete.Bouldery moves off the ground with good? gear. (in a hollow sounding plate) followed by much better gear and bigger holds to the top. Pumpy! or maybe its just because its the warmup.Maybe doesn't warrant a pg13 but the gear in the hollow plate (that protects the crux) is not too inspiring and would not be pretty if it failed.# Location
Rightmost route.# Protection
Single rack. Small - #2 BD. Wires. We had some smallish offset cams which were really nice for the beginning of this route.Its nice to set up an anchor (#1,#2) before climbing the route so you can just clip in and lower.
