# Description
Dying Breed follows the pretty seams and cracks through the nice varnish. Falling before your first piece would not be too fun, especially with out a pad. Once through the initial sequence and you have your first piece this climb is not run out, just spicy!Start on two chalked up small plates, take a deep breath and pull bouldery moves up and left to a stance to get your first piece. Continue up the steep wall with pretty good gear, there will be a section or 2 that feels a little bold. Get a good rest and gear before punching through the great finish on this classic test piece.It is easy to rap and check out placements before tying in... I'm glad I did.# Location
second route from the left.  between the 11c on the arete and the bolted 12c# Protection
Mostly small. Bring the c3s, small masters (to a yellow), rps and wires. it has 2 bolts for the anchor. The pro is good but you'll have to work for it and want an attentive belayer
