# Description
At the top of the approach gully, thin friction moves gain a crack that goes upward and curves over to a good ledge on the right side of the buttress.  Continue up the steep varnished crack until you can move left and up onto the ledges beneath a big overhang split by an ominous chimney.  Follow this chimney to the top. Scramble up to the north shoulder rappel.# Location
