# Description
From about a quarter of the way up the approach gully, scramble up and left onto ledge beneath a triangular "sub-buttress."  Follow discontinuous cracks up and left on deteriorating rock to the top of the sub-buttress.  Continue up less-than-stellar rock to ledges beneath the headwall on Uptown Hustler.  Move slightly right and climb a reddish crack to the top, or follow one of the Uptown Hustler variations.  Scramble north to the summit.# Location
