# Description
This route goes up the crack directly up the middle of the varnished face to the left ofLincoln Tunnel.  The first pitch is on pleasant varnish to a perch beneath the overhang.  The wise belayer will move his stance to the right, as the overhang above is strenuous and loose, and falling rock would threaten a belayer below.  (In fact, the really wise belayer would probably move all the way right to Lincoln tunnel and continue on that route.)  In any case, continue to the obvious rappel points and descend.For the true masochists, the original start was up the loose lower buttress nearBowery Bums, but this has little to recommend it.# Location
