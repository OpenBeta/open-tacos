# Description
About three quarters of the way up the approach gully is an attractive wall with a band of featured varnish on its lower section.  Three crack systems go up through this varnish.  This route follows the leftmost (southern) cracks.  Climb the discontinuous crack system until it ends. Then move up and right to a chimney leading to the top.  Scramble right to the north shoulder rappel.# Location
