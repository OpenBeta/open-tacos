# Description
Just below the top of the approach gully is a crack system marked by three obvious bushes.  Climb these cracks until progress is blocked by a big overhang.  Though improbable, the overhang is not that hard, and leads to a short third class gully and the top. Scramble right to the north shoulder rappel.# Location
