# Description
About three quarters of the way up the approach gully is an attractive wall with a band of featured varnish on its lower section.  Three crack systems go up through this varnish.  This route follows the rightmost (northern) crack.  Climb the crack up through the right side of the upper varnish patch, then up and left to the exit chimney. Scramble right to the north shoulder rappel.# Location
