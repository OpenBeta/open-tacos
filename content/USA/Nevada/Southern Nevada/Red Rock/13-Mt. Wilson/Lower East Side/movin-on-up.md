# Description
Start about halfway up the approach gully.  Scramble (class 3 or 4) up into a left-leaning gully.  Follow this up to a point just below the start ofLincoln Tunnel.  Climb up and right to gain an obvious vertical crack system.  Follow this to a good ledge beneath a varnished off-width.  The off-width is not hard, but you won't get much protection without a large cam.  Continue up the crack system until you can traverse left toLincoln Tunnelfor rappel.# Location
