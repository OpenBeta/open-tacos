# Description
Enough has been written and rewritten about the Res to confuse anyone including the first ascentionists. Suffice it to say that (imho) the best and most accurate description of the approach and climb can be found in Joanne Urioste's new Red Book Supplement. This is a very big route not a casual day at the crags. 1.5 hours to approach and 3 hours to descend, not to mention how ever long it takes to climb the route. This is really more of a desert mountaineering route. You will encounter a little (or a lot) of every thing the Red Rocks has to offer, except the crowds. You will be very much "on your own".# Location
# Protection
A very full backcountry rack up to a #4 Camalot. Lots of wired stoppers, slings and doubles in the 1-1.5" range.
