# Description
The 2hr approach makes this route a well earned prize.  Just keep moving west from the base of Resolution Arete til you get to the west side of Aeolian Tower.  Climb straight up easy/wide cracks forming the west side of the Aeolian Tower for 3 pitches then the crux bolted pitch awaits on the main wall.  Spicy and fun, the crux comes at the start of pitch 4 and it's well protected but a bit of a zig zag, since Joanne bolted it on lead with hooks!  After that, it remains a steep mostly direct line that trends a bit left to top out.  The very last couple pitches are a bit loose but nothing unmanageable.  Get a late return ticket because you will take all day.  Joanne and I started walking at 0430 from the highway and returned to the car @ 11pm.  Awesome climb and lady.# Location
