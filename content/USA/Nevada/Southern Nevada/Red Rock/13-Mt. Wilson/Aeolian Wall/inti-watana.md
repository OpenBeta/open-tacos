# Description
Inti Watana is an excellent face and crack climb.  Although there are bolts on most pitches, it is not a sport climb.  This climb is grade V if Combined with the upper portion of resolution arete.  If anyone has first ascent info, please post.Approach mount wilson from the old oak creek campground.  Look for gully with a red and white rock cliff at the base.  Continue up and around this and into the gully with cairns.  When you reach a large pine tree go around to the left and up gully with a massive chock stone.  Tunnel under the chock stone and look up to the right for bolts on the first pitch.P1- Follow bolts up rock that climbs much better than it looks (5.10-).P2- The crux of the route.  Continue up the beautiful and intimidating head wall past many bolts to a belay stance (5.10+).P3 through P9- Many pitches up to (5.9) in difficulty.  Mixed gear and bolted climbing.  One pitch is long and has no bolts on it.P10- Climb up past many bolts on the the overhanging wall.  The position is amazing on this pitch (5.9).P11- Short pitch up past more bolts (5.9).P12- The last pitch of the route.  Continue up through an overhang and crack to the top of the pillar(5.9+).From here the last part of resolution arete may be climbed or rappel the route.  Bring some extra webbing for the rappel.  If continuing to the top of Mount Wilson descend to a saddle and drop into first creek.  This descent seems to have never ending gully travel.  Once out of first creek walk the road back to the car.# Location
