# Description
This route climbs a widening offwidth and overhanging squeeze chimney. One of a kind type of crack and a very memorable experience, one way or another. Lowering is exposed and enjoyably terrifying, 70m mandatory.# Location
On the approach to the Basin wall. Walk up the left hand gully past the Mass Extinction crag until you see a looming offwdith/squeeze chimney on the right hand side of the gulley.# Protection
#5, #6, many Big Bros. 70m rope.
