Hike up the White Rot Gully and descend in to the main Aeolian Wall drainage to the mouth Willy's Couloir. Proceed up into the large gully and aim for the first recess on the right. Pink Tornado Left starts on the main wall that is behind the right side of a 200 foot tall white triangular flake.Once on the Sherwood Forest ledges you can rappelDogmawith a single 70m rope. Or you can climb another route (ie.,Gwondonna Land Boogieor Scotty) up to summit Mount Wilson. This would make for a climb with one of the greatest elevation gains in the park.From the base of the route it is unnecessary to hike back up to the White Rot Gully. Walk down to the lowest point of the Aeolian Wall gully where further progress is cliffed out by waterfalls. Two rappels with a single 60m rope get you down. This is much easier than downclimbing the White Rot.# Protection
Standard rack up to a single #4 Camalot.
