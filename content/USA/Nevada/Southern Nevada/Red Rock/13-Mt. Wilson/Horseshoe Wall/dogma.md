# Description
I am posting a topo of the route instead of describing each pitch in detail. This is all I had to send the route from Flyn Brian, but it was horrible, so I recreated one. Wonderful route. Take the Black Velvet Wall and drop it 1,000 feet above the desert floor. This is the definition of "desert rockaneering".# Location
