# Description
Start off of Sherwood Forest about 200' right of the start to the route Scotty, up hill from the big trees. This route is very sustained and thoughtful. Climb up through crack systems, thin corners and roofs all the way up to the mid wall horizontal ledge system with large trees. You are in fact aiming for the first big tree on the ledge. Traverse left along the horizontal ledge to the base of the prominent chimney/corner. Three solid pitches deposits you atop the wall and a magnificent panorama.# Location
# Protection
Don't expect bolts, fixed gear or fixed anchors! This is a serious, purely trad, ground up experience. A standard Red Rocks grade V wall rack with extra attention to small gear will be appreciated. There are some spicy, prehaps spooky runouts and thin pro sections to contend with, but this is a spectacular climb and well worth the effort if you are comfortable with the grade and difficulties. The 8th pitch (after the traverse left) is wide and difficult to protect. Modern big gear will undoubtedly be very appreciated. As will keeping your fertilizer together when it starts snowing.
