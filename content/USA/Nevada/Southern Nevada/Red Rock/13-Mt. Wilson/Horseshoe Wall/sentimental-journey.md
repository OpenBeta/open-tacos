# Description
This was the very first route on the east face of Wilson, and one of the earliest big routes at Red Rock.  It was climbed in 1970 by John Williamson and Keith Hogan using a variation that ascended Willie's Couloir, then cut back right for upper headwall.  The adventurous teenagers spent three days on the route.  Local master Joe Herbst (who did not know Williamson and was unaware of his climb) climbed the route solo the following year on the day before his wedding.  Joe considers the route a milestone that marked the beginning of "serious" climbing in Red Rock.  This is an old-time adventure route and deserves an old-time adventurous description:Climb a gully to the right side of Sherwood Forest.  Climb the central crack system on the right-hand headwall to the summit.# Location
