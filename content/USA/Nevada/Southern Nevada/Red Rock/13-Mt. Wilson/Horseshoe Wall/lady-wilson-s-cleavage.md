# Description
This a long, serious route, following mostly wide cracks.  It is not actually on the Horseshoe Wall, but that's close enough for now...Routefinding is easy on this one, once you find your way to the base.  Check the accompanying photo from Red Rock Odyssey to find the line for the approach.From the rope-up spot, climb six pitches up the obvious crack.  Then go right in the gully and chimney system to the top.  The most obvious descent is through First Creek.There is an entire chapter about this route inRed Rock Odyssey# Location
