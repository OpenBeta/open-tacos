# Description
Good moderate usual Black Corridor route with a crux up high to pull the bulge before the anchors, the last bolt is kinda a awkward clip.  Good route worth doing.# Location
This is the very first route on the left wall (East Facing) in the upper section of the Black Corridor and just 5 feet beyond the rock fall/blocks.  This and the next two routes (Crude Street Blues & Crude Behavior) are very similar.# Protection
Route has 6 Bolts to some fixed anchors and your rappel!
