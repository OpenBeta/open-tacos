# Description
Another Black Corridor route, this time with the crux down low with one heck of a tricky mantel move.# Location
This is the 5th route on the left wall (East Facing) in the Upper Black Corridor and only 4-5 feet to the right of Dancin' with a God.  Start the route on a small left facing flake and pull the difficult mantel about 10 feet up.# Protection
5 Bolts should find you at the fixed anchors for your rappel; stick clipping the first bolt on this route would be recommended.
