# Description
I love this route and IMHO is one of the better routes in the corridor.  The crux bottom is tough small crimpers and really cool 5.10 terrain for a long ways until one last thin crux again at the top!# Location
This is the second route on the right wall (West Facing).  Start on the crack/ramp to the right for the first two clips and then move straight onto the very thin face!# Protection
I believe it had 6 bolts to the fixed chains up top.  Pretty easy to set up a top tope from the 757 2X4 route to its right!
