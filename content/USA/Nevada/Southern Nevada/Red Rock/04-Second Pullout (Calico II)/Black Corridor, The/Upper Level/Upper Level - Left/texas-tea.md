# Description
This route is about 10a if starting to the right a couple feet and climbing up to the ledge to clip the first bolt; probably 10c/d if going directly under the first bolt.  Great route with consistent movement and some thin moves in the middle.  I recommend this route!!# Location
This is the 7th route on the left wall (East Facing) in the upper Black Corridor area and the second route from the end.  Begins at a black wall with the first bolt on a small ledge about 9 feet up.# Protection
The usual 5 bolts will find you at the fixed anchors for your rappel.
