# Description
The crux of this similar Black Corridor route is at the beginning and a stick clip might be in order.  Long ways between first and second bolts to so a tricky mantle is involved.  Good sport route but shorties might find some of the clips hard to reach!# Location
This route is the 6th route on the left wall (East Facing) in the upper Black Corridor and only 5 feet to the right of "Live Fast"; begin at a small right facing flake.# Protection
5 Bolts will find you at the fixed anchors for your rappel!
