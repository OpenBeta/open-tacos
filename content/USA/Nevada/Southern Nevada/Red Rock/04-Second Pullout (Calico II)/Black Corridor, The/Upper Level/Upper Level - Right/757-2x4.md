# Description
This is a really fun climb that gets easier the higher you go. The crux involves a balancy corner about a third of the way up, and right below a small roofed edge.The numeric name comes from the fact that it is a 7 bolt 5.7, and a section of a 2x4 plank was used to assist in the anchoring while the route was bolted.**Note: One concern is that the anchors are set back behind the top of the climb, creating a lot of friction on the rope as you lower off. For very small climbers (kids) it can be almost impossible to get enough weight on the rope to get them back to the ground, resulting in some forceful down climbing.  As there are already numerous links on the chains above, the only likely solution would be to add another anchor bolt below the current anchors to reduce the rope drag.# Location
This route is a new addition to the corridor, and a welcomed climb for novices who are not looking to start their day on a 5.9... As you climb above the dividing boulders that separate the lower corridor from the upper, this route is the first on your right, and climbs the right-leaning crack/ramp.# Protection
7 bolts to two anchors (one with extended webbing)
