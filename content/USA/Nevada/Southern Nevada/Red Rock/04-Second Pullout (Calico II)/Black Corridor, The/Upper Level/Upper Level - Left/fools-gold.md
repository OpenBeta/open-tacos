# Description
Really fun route with a crux right after clipping first bolt (somewhat difficult clip at second bolt).  Seems like an aweful long ways to the third bolt but the climb is a tad bit easier going here.  Move toward the huge hueco at the top and pull the really fun bulge to finish out; really fun route!!# Location
This is the last route on the left wall (East FAcing) in the upper section of the Black Corridor, can't miss it!# Protection
6 Bolts will have you seeing the chains on top for your rappel.
