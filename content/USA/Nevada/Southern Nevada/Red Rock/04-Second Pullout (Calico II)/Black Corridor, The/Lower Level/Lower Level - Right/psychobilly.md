# Description
This route is awesome!  Probably one of the top four routes in the corridor if you can climb at this grade. Climb the easy holds up to the third bolts and then crimp your way to a great left handed undercling. This will require smearing you feet on the way up. There is a two finger pocket for your right hand, followed by a few more crimps as you move upward. The top section to the anchors is relatively easy climbing after the crux.# Location
This line was bolted after Roxanna's new guide was published, so it is not included in her topo. It is the fourth route on the right as you enter the corridor from the lower approach, and follows the obvious thin crack to a huge undercling flake.# Protection
Seven bolts to the new chain anchor.
