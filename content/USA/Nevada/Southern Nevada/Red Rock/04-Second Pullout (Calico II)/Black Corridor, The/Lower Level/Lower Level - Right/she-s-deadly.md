# Description
The first clip can easily be clipped while you undercling in the large alcove, and the second after climbing out of it onto a tilted ledge. The next move is an obvious muscly sidecling with a really high left foot. It's pretty well protected because the third bolt is above the move. After the move you reach both arms over the hump and scramble to a larger ledge. The fourth bolt is an awkward clip, and I suggest clipping it from a single step above the ledge. Your right foot is on a slope, and there are two extremely chalked but solid sideclings with your right hand. I used the lower, better hold. The options for your left hand are all around the bolt and all are pretty bad. I suggest holding one for a moment so you can get a toehook with your left foot before clipping with your left hand. The fifth bolt is the crux, and I suggest a compression off two side pulls to a high foot, crossing your right hand to the 45 degree lip Â on the left. Climbing is much easier from the final ledge to the anchor, so enjoy the victory lap.# Location
2 feet past the small tree, there is a small lip that travels up from the ground and a prominent hole 8 feet off the ground.# Protection
6-7 bolts to an anchor
