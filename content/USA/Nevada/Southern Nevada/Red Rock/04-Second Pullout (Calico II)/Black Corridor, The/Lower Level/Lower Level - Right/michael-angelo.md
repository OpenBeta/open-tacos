# Description
Starts off fun and easy with interesting holes and huecos to use, gets more difficult midway through as the holds become smaller. The crux seems to be clipping the anchors at the little headwall at the top - started out easy,but many of the original holds I used when I did the first ascent have vanished. I named it as a memorial to my bro Mike who I lost this year, a hero to me.# Location
The route is the fifth one up on the right lower side as you are coming into the corridor. It is betweenPsychobillyandM & M. It starts at the first small tree. Please take care not to injure tree.# Protection
There are seven bolts and chain anchors.
