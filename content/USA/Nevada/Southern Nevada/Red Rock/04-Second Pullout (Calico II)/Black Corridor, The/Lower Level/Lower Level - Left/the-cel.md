# Description
This climb is more slabby in nature than the other routes in the corridor. No one move is a crux, but several of the moves require balance.# Location
This is now the first route on the left as you enter the corridor. This line was bolted after Roxanna's new guide was published, so it is not included in her topo.# Protection
Several bolts to a shiny new chain anchor.
