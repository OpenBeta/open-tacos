# Description
This is a new route in the corridor- the third on your left as you enter the lower tier, it ascends an obvious line of features.Care should be taken on this route as many of the features are hollow and the route is still shedding rock. The bolts are also spaced somewhat, so be mindful.# Location
Third route on left.# Protection
Bolts to anchor
