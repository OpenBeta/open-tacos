# Description
Really kind of a bomb because of its contrived nature, not because of the rock.  Beginning right of Vagabonds (but left of the boulders that separate the corridor) this route starts up a short steep section involving a move from a digit hold to a shelf above.  Can be easily cheated by just reaching right for a ramp and climbing via that.  Two bolts protect the crux, with 5 more to the anchors.# Location
