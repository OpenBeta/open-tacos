# Description
Descent moves up descent rock. Climb the thin edges after the ramp, and run it out across a flake to the fourth bolt.Both 'Burros' climbs receive afternoon sun so plan to climb them when you're looking for some rays!  =)# Location
This route is the third in from the entrance of the corridor. Start by climbing the right leaning ramp to the first bolt, then continue straight up.# Protection
Several bolts up to an anchor (This anchor used to be shared with Burros Don't Gamble, but now has its own).
