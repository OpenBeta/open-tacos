# Description
Vagabonds is located on the left side of the lower section of the Black Corridor. Close to the boulders that separate the two tiers, on the left side, there is a trad route, BCR 5L. Its most prominent feature is a large crack up high. Vagabonds is the next route to the right from the crack. The 5.10a rating can be mitigated a bit by wandering a little and seeking an easier path. Lower off with one rope.# Location
