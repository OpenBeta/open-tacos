Cruxy from the third to the fourth bolt and a steep finish to the anchors. It's still a bit chossy from he fourth to the seventh bolt but it should clean up with traffic.# Location
The sixth route on the lower right side of the corridor just past Michael Angelo 5.11a on the lower right side. It starts between two small trees just left of a right-arching flake.# Protection
7 bolts plus 2 chain anchors
