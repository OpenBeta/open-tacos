# Description
Fun and rewarding; not the most solid sandstone, though, so still getting a little harder as holds and parts of holds join the sand dune below. Pumpy up to and through the crux on mostly positive holds, then easy cruisin' to the top. There are easier sequences for the savvy RR climber to find past the traverse.# Location
Far left route on crag, obvious due to splitter looking RF corner/flake.# Protection
