# Description
The crux occurs after the second mantle move, when you have to pull through a small left hand crimp. I rated this route PG-13, in that if you fell before clipping the second bolt (while performing the first mantle) you would likely fall onto the huge boulder underneath. This route is really more like three small boulder problems, in that you could fall asleep resting on the ledges after you pull the moves.  =)# Location
This is the obvious arete to the west as you head towards the black corridor, before you enter the tanks. It is one of the most easily photogenic route I've climbed.# Protection
