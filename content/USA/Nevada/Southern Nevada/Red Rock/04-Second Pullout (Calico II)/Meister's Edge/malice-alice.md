# Description
Start at the obvious finger crack on the right hand wall (when approaching route) and climb through varnished rock into a pink band and through 3-4 small ceilings.  At the final ceiling traverse right and protect in a hueco and climb the crispy but easier face to the top# Location
Directly across from SandMan (near Meisters Edge) is a corridor running to the east.  Walk down this corridor and you will see the route beginning on the right.  Its steep and the top has rock that looks a little less than inspiring.# Protection
single rack through #2 camalot.  Doubles in the finger sizes.
