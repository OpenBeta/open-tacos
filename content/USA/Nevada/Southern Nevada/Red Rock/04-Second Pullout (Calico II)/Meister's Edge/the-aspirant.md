# Description
This route powers out the overhanging bulge that is the North face of the Meister's Edge block.  It requires a good deal of crimping power, as it is essentially a campus board for the first couple of bolts.  Higher the route becomes much more technical, with a difficult, sequential and spicy finish.# Location
Immediately right of Meister's edge, on the same formation.  Begins down in a bit of a pit.# Protection
