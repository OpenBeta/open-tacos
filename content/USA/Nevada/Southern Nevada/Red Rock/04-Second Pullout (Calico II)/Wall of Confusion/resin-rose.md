# Description
I almost want to give this 3 stars, but since the route is pretty dirty and most people aren't really into this sort of thing, I'm not sure I can in good conscience.  If you do like wide crack/chimney problems, Resin Rose should be on your Red Rocks tick list.Begin in the alcove a short scramble up and right from Fear and Loathing and climb the obvious crack.  Fairly easy climbing through guano leads up into the bowels of this beast where a fixed wire and sling provide crux pro.  From here, all but the smallest of 12 year old OW aficionados will have to climb down and outwards across the bottomless maw before once again worming upwards to a thank god jug/handjam and gear.  The fall from the crux is spectacular, scary, but seemingly quite safe.  Continue more easily up the steep crack to more bird crap and an annoying anchor shared with the sport climb on the right.  Beware of sharp edges if you choose to lower (it might be better to rap).# Location
# Protection
Ignore the recommendations of 5" and 8" pieces.  A double set to #2 Camalot is perfect.  Anything bigger will undoubtedly get in your way.  Long pants and some handi wipes would not go unappreciated.
