# Description
Handren describes this route as a "mystery that sees little traffic". It looks fairly imposing from the ground that much is certain.# Location
On the left side of the trundle wall is a bolted line between "Standing in the Shadows" and "Pocket Rocket" , this is Master Beta.# Protection
6 bolts to an anchor. The quality of the anchor at the top is unknown. I couldn't get a good look at it but it appeared to have a good streak of rust running down the wall directly underneath it 10/8/2015 [Will update with new information once available]
