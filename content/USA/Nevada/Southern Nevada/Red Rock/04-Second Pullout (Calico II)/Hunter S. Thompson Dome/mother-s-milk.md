# Description
This is the best of the three new routes that have been added to the left end of HSTD, and the easiest. Fun movements and good holds will make this route more popular for climbers seeking to climb moderates in the sun by the Black Corridor or Sweet Pain.Start in the honeycombish pockets and follow the varnished holds to the top.*NOTE* This route is still relatively new as of this posting (11/06) and although I spent some time cleaning more of the broken rock, there is considerable breakage of the rock edges that haven't yet been worn down. I would advise wearing a helmet to belay until these routes get some more traffic.# Location
This route is the third route in from the far left end of HSTD. Head left of the obvious roof behind an outcrop. You climb/shimmy/stem up a small chimney to a sloping ledge below this and the two other routes to the left of it.# Protection
Seven bolts to chain anchors.
