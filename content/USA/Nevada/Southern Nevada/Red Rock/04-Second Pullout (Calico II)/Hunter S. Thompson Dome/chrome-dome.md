# Description
This route was said to be considered a 5.10, but I feel it is more in the 5.9 range. It is more difficult if you follow the direct bolt line (5.9+ maybe) but it appears that most parties stay left of the bolts until after the bulge.*NOTE* This route is still relatively new as of this posting (11/06) and although I spent some time cleaning more of the broken rock, there is considerable breakage of the rock edges that haven't yet been worn down. I would advise wearing a helmet to belay until these routes get some more traffic.# Location
This route is located at the far left end of HSTD. Head left of the obvious roof behind an outcrop. You climb/shimmy/stem up a small chimney to a sloping ledge below this and the two other routes.# Protection
Seven bolts to the chain anchors.
