# Description
A single long pitch to climb the cliff on sparse or interesting gear. A 60M rope MIGHT make the top, but I did it with a 70M and believe it would be a close call. As well, the bottom of the route is hard and would be a terrible place for a climber to fall simul-climbing.Climb from the base of Gonzo Dogs, going up and right past some short slashes/seams/cracks to access the bottom of several bolts. Continue up these and to the face above to finish on easier, but runout climbing.  Belay up top from trad gear.# Location
This is the right-most of the slab routes on the dome and climbs from the base of Gonzo Dogs, to the right to access a different set of bolts and gear. This is just left of the super-steep "Fear and Loathing II"# Protection
A rack of thinner gear, from small nuts to tcu's plus a few draws for the bolts. The route will be heady.
