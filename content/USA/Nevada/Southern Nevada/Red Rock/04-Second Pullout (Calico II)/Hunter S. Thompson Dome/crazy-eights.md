# Description
This is a long route, and serves as a good warm-up. Climb the vertical varnished face through a series of high feet and good holds to the top. A few sections seemed to be confusing to the less experienced climbers in our group.This route used ALL of a 50m rope, so it would be wise to knot the end of the rope as a protective measure when lowering-off.*NOTE* This route is still relatively new as of this posting (11/06) and although I spent some time cleaning more of the broken rock, there is considerable breakage of the rock edges that haven't yet been worn down. I would advise wearing a helmet to belay until these routes get some more traffic.# Location
This route is located one line to the right of the far left end of HSTD. Head left of the obvious roof behind an outcrop. You climb/shimmy/stem up a small chimney to a sloping ledge below this and the two other routes on each side of it.# Protection
Nine bolts to the chain anchors.
