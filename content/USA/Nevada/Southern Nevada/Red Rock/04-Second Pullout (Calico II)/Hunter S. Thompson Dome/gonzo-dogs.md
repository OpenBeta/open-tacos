# Description
The climb is described as a 2pitch climb by swain, with a 140' pitch followed by a  second to the top, but I did not find a good stance of anchor and preferred to climb this as a single 225' (70-meter) pitch to the top of the cliff.Climb the right-most of the two left-leaning cracks on the left side of the wall to reach a big hueco and some bolts. Clip and go to reach a second crack system that runs out before the climb does- and leaves the leader to finish on a heady but moderate face.Belay up top on trad gear.# Location
Toward the left-hand side of the crag, and just right of 'Walking the Vertical Beach' there is another route with left-leaning crack system that is followed to access a few bolts and then another crack though a small roof.# Protection
A standard light rack plus bolts for draws. There are places where you will be climbing well above gear, but not difficult moves.
