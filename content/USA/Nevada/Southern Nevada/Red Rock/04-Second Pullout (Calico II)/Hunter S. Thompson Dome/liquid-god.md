# Description
Start about 40' right of Fear and Loathing and locate the low first protection bolt in a small right facing corner.  Boulder out the overhanging start and get established on the face.  Follow the crack with good pro up and to the second bolt. From here angle slightly left to the anchor.# Location
The anchor on this one needs some love. There are two bolts with the hangers only. There are currently some slings choked to the hangers with a single quick link for lowering/rapping, which is all in good shape now, but will soon become useless due to the elements.# Protection
This route has two protection bolts and doesn't require anything larger than a .75"  Offset stoppers work great as well.
