# Description
This route climbs the left hand edge of the Magic Bus wall. Although there is nothing really wrong with the route, it's not quite as good as others on the cliff, having rock of less quality and being a little shorter.Climb the now-bolted line at the left edge of the crag to reach the anchors up and right, above Blonde Dwarf.# Location
