# Description
To find this route first locate Neon Sunset, as described on this site.From Neon Sunset, walk 3 meters right to a set of thin cracks tending up and right (Zipperhead) then 2 more meters to the left edge of a pyramid like feature.Climb up on this then straight up the wall passing (5 bolts, now that it was retrobolted...) to reach a fixed anchor. The line is pretty straight and continuous and is a nice climb.According to the Swain book, this route will take small wires at the base, but I don't recall inspiring protection and instead just bouldered it out with a spot from my belayer. This route might not be the best for a blooming leader.Again, the retrobolts make the Swain book advice and former comments on that irrelevant but for historical context and ethical considerations.  It appears that gear is not needed anymore.# Location
# Protection
A light rack of small gear can supplement the 4 bolts on this climb, but not terribly well. Expect a minor runout either way.
