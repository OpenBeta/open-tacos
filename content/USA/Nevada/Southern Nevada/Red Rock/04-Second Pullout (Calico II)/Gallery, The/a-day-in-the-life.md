# Description
This route has sustained crimps throughout, and is slightly overhanging. A very fun start leads to a great pump as you keep climbing. Near the end you have the option of some more small crimps or a dynamic dead point. Either way you finish, this route is solid for the grade and a very enjoyable climb.# Location
Begin by starting at the small tree/bush and climbing out the right side of the pod in the middle of the wall. Continue up to the anchors through a series of crimps.# Protection
Several bolts to the chain anchors.
