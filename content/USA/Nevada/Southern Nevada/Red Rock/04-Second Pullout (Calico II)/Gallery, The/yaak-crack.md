# Description
This along with the Gift probably constitute the two most classic sport routes at the Gallery.  This one is exceedingly popular, so best to be patient if you plan on giving this one multiple tries.Fun pumpy climbing follows the crack system, though no actual crack climbing is required.  As with the other routes at the Gallery, this one is probably a bit soft compared to similarly graded climbs at, say, Rifle.  Classic and awesome climbing, nonetheless.# Location
# Protection
6 bolts to the anchor on the right side of the crack
