# Description
A pretty soft touch at 12d. The crux is a long reach to an undercling, easier when you're tall. It's approximately 3/4 up.The route is excellent, around the same difficulty than the Gift.# Location
The route on the right ofThe Gift. The Gift is the climb with the longest queue...lower from top anchors.# Protection
The draws are there, except for the first one.
