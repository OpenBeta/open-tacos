# Description
The route name is a tribute to Mr. Denny Goode who first took me to The Gallery some 17 years ago and has been a consistently positive and encouraging member of the local climbing community for many years.  A great climber and an all around good dude!Another warm-up at The Gallery.  Feels a bit easier than the 5.8 to the right.# Location
