# Description
One of the best and most famous hard-12 sport climbs in North America.  It's been called 12c for years, but most of the current guidebooks now rate it 12d.  This is an awesome, steep, strenuous route, involving thuggish climbing to a delicate crux at the very end.Much of the climbing in the lower section would probably clock in at about 12a/b.  The crux, involving a technical high step and reach to an elusive pebble, is not that hard in of itself, but the precision required for this move is usually hard to come by after the pumpy climbing below.  For those who project in this grade range, the key to the redpoint is to ruthlessly wire the lower section so that one can arrive at the crux fresh.On a sunny winter day, one can enjoyably spend the afternoon watching numerous people cruising the lower section only to be spit off by the crux, again and again and again.# Location
