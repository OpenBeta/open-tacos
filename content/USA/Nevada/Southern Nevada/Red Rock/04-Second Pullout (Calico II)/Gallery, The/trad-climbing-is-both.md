# Description
This climb starts at the bottom of the obvious right leaning crack to the left of Sport Climbing is Neither. Pitch one is approx. 100 feet. Belay to the far left on a platform. Protect the horizontal crack with hand-sized gear. Pitch two starts right along the face, then up and left up the obvious crack. Belay at the tripod pedestal rock using slings or cordalette. Bring slings to leave and rap rings or walk off down the gulley behind the climb to the right. Bring approach shoes! We did not rap off, so we don't know all the details.Also, no idea if this is an actual first ascent... The name is obvious, so if it has been climbed, I bet it's called this already.  If anyone knows of a previous FA party, let us know!# Location
Left of Sport Climbing is Neither.# Protection
Finger to hand size cams, standard nut rack.Placements are not necessarily straightforward...You may consider the second pitch to be more of a scramble...
