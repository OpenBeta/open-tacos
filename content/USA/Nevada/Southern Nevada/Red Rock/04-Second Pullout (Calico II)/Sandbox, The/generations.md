# Description
This is an old project, #7 in the Handren book. Begins with some big moves between good, albeit sandy ledges (crag theme). A few really cool dimples, and a gym like left hand jug lead you to the first crux. Move straight right with a right knee smear on some right facing edges. From this stance work your left hand onto a heinous sloper above the lip and pounce up and right to a big flat ledge. Finish out the bullet slab.A really fun, punchy little route. I filled in a drilled 2 finger pocket next to the sloper in the crux.The rock quality after the first bolt or so is bomber. A worthwhile route along with several of the other rigs at this secluded shady crag.# Location
