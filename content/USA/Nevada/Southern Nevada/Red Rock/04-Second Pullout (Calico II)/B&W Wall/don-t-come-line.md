# Description
I think the movement on this route makes it worthwhile.P1.10a. 60'. Start up the corner (2 bolts) and pull around the left. A few large nuts or small cams and a .75 camalot in a horizontal will protect you until the 2nd bulge.  Above, sling a horn and move right of the blank section of rock.  Bravely pull up to very good holds and locks that allow you to pull up to the anchor ledge.P2. 5.8. 120'.  Head up the crack directly above the anchor.  When the cracks starts to pinch down head right and run it out to the bolt.  Make another 20' run-out to the 2nd bolt (5.7).  Continue climbing to the top past more bolts, all in a straight line and easily located.  Bolted anchor.# Location
From the bottom this climb is in front of the approach, typically above a puddle on the right side.# Protection
4 bolts and slung horns on each pitch. Nuts. .75 camalot.Optional .3-.5.2 raps with a 70m rope. (First one juuust makes it)
