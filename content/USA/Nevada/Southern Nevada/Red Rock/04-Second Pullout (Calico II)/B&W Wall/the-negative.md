# Description
Real deal Wonderly route, and definitely the hardest and most serious on the wall.   This route climbs the varnished crack below the "hill" on the left.  Scramble down from Black Streak.Climb the varnished crack, fiddling in a nut or two before the first bolt (20' up).  Another 10' gets you to the 2nd bolt. Another 30', maybe there's a nut or slung horn, until the 3rd bolt. The last bit is easier, 5.5? but you'll be going a ways before you sling another horn 15' below the anchor.# Location
Furthest left route on this wall.  Start down in the hole below Black Streak.# Protection
4 bolts (all modern). Nuts. Slung horns.  A single 70m allows you to rappel to the right and reach the top of the "hill".
