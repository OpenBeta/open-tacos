# Description
This route is pretty good and seems to last forever.  Take it serious right off the ground, taking the right trending crack to the bolt and pull the lip.  Run up to the headwall, clip some bolts, and memorably sling the horn above your head.Above this brief vertical section the route catches a methodical slab rhythm.  One more crux (5.8 mantle) will give you pause, but be the thing you talk about back at the bags.# Location
Right of Black Streak, marked by a rightward varnished crack.# Protection
There are no options for trad gear on this route. 12 bolts and one or two slung horns. Long and wandery so bring slings.
