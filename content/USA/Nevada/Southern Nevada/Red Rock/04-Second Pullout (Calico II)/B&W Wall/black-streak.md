# Description
This is the line you can see from the loop, and it's exactly what it looks like.  Fun slab climbing bottom to top, with a final bulge pull to the anchor.  Bring a cam (.3-.75) for that final crack.# Location
From the bottom scramble on top of the "hill" and start at the bottom of the black streak.  From the top, the anchor can be accessed scrambling down to a ledge.# Protection
4 new bolts, finger size cams or tricams from black to blue, one finger sized cam for the last move.
