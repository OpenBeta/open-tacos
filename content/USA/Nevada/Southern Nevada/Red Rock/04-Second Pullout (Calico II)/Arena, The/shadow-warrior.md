# Description
Shadow Warrior is the obvious chalk line up the middle of the wall.  It is very fun and worth doing, but still has a bit of graininess.  Begin through a bouldery section that uses the big huecos to start and then set up for a dynamic throw. Continue up the headwall with edges and side pulls, making sure to keep your pump in check.  I really think that this is a worthwhile climb, full of energetic moves on solid rock.# Location
