# Description
This is a new route up the canyon to the east of the black corridor. The first bolt is barely visible but trust me its right past the crack and you can get some gear below and in the crack. The first pitch is about 180 feet long with 5 or six bolts and the second pitch is about 110 feet long with about 5 bolts.# Location
Before entering the Black Corridor make a right up the canyon and hike for about 200 yards. About 50 yards before the top of the canyon look up and left at a 300 foot face. Hike up to the base of the face and look for a right trending crack about 15-20 feet long. Start just below this.# Protection
Bring a rack of nuts and TCU's to supplement the bolts.
