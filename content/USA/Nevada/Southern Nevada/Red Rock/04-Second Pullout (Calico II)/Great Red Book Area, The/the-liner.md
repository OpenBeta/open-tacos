# Description
Climbs the straight, slightly right-angling handcrack on the left side of the rock.  It's a pretty straightforward climb, with plenty of gear in the crack and featured rock on the face. This route appears in Handren's 2007 Guidebook.# Location
About 150' left of The Great Red Book proper.# Protection
Singles to 3" should do it. The anchors are off to the right on a ramp, so make sure to extend your last piece. There are quicklinks, not rap rings, so make sure to rappel instead of lowering if you don't want to pig-tail your rope.
