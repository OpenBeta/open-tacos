# Description
A great route that is very similar to subject verb agreement on this same wall.  The route is actually two pitches, the first pitch is VERY well protected to say the least and has closer to 12 bolts rather than the 8 it mentions in the guidebook.  The rock is kinda fragile so take care but the route is very fun nonetheless!  Please note that the second pitch is VERY runout and has only one bolt in 90 feet but on easier 5.6 type terrain but still fragile rock so take caution if going for the top!!# Location
This route is on the sunny Great Red Book Wall, about 100 yards right of the Great Red Book itself.  It is about 40 feet left of Subject Verb Agreement and directly above a great belay spot to hide from the sun.  You can reach it by hiking around on a ledge below the face, and into a 8' deep gully between the ledge and face. This climb is 20 feet left of a place where it is easy to step down into the gully. Follow the obvious line of bolts!# Protection
First pitch is overbolted with about 12-13 draws with fixed anchors.  The second pitch is rarely done and has one bolt in 90 feet but there are fixed rappel anchors at the top of pitch two.
