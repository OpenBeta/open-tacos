# Description
This route is just to the right of Liner. You might not have noticed it because the first bolt is way up there. Not like the normal clip-up RR sport routes. Just 3 bolts. Goes through fun plate pulling on mostly good rock, but still a little crumbly. You might be able to get a nut or chicken head for pro, but the patina was a little brittle, so it probably wouldn’t hold a whip. Anyone know FA info?# Location
Left side of Great Red Book area between Liner and Reservations Required.# Protection
3 bolts to chain anchor. Bolts and anchor look good.
