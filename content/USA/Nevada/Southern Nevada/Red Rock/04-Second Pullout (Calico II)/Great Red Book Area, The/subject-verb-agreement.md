# Description
Named for our president, who often ignores this rule of grammar: "Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream." (George W. Bush, 2000)This route is not the right-most on the cliff, but it is the farthest right route that contains a significant number of bolts.  This is one of the few routes on this crag that is not runout.# Location
This route is about 100 yards right (south) of the Great Red Book.  Hike around on a ledge below the face, soon a gully forms between the ledge and the face.  Climb down into it, and look for the last set of bolts, the first one just above a black, varnished section.# Protection
7 or 8 bolts.
