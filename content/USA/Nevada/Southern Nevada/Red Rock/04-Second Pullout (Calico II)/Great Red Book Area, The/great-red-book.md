# Description
This is a great route and the site of the rappelling error that led to the fate of renowned Red Rock climber and guide Randal Grandstaff.The location of this climb is obvious.  It more or less climbs the giant left facing dihedral, aka The Great Red Book...P1 (5.8): Climb up past a few vegetated ledges and work over into the corner proper for about 10-15 ft.  When the crack becomes too thin, head back out onto the face and up to the bolted anchor where a memorial for Randall has been scratched into the rock (technically this is a chipped route :)P2 (5.8 PG): Climb up the face on small edges past 2 bolts and lieback around the OW in the corner.  Shoot for the top via the face or chimney.Descend by heading left and working your way down and back around the wall.# Location
