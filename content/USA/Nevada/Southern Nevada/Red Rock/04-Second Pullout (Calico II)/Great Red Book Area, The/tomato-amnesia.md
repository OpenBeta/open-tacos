# Description
Start just left of the mushroom boulder, aiming for a bolt 20' above. Climb up and right, then left to the base of a curving crack. Follow the crack to an anchor, having clipped five bolts getting to and into the crack.The second pitch follows the crack up the short steep wall, then up the slab to an anchor with chains at a horizontal seam. Another bolt above the belay invites further climbing.... new hardware to us.There is a fragile flake left of the crack, between the two bolts, that will last as long as no one pulls out on it.Handren's guide rates the second pitch at 5.5. We thought it significantly harder.# Location
The route is on the wall right of Great Red Book. There are bolts all over the place, but you are left of the mushroom and some small scrub oaks.# Protection
Stoppers, tcu's,  and small cams to #1 Cam. 5 bolts first pitch, 2 on second.
