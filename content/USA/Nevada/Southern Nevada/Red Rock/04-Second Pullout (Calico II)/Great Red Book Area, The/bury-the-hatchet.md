# Description
Although only 50' long, Bury the Hatchet has great moves and achieves a rather spectacular position.  Well worth climbing if you're  up at the Great Red Book.Climb the first pitch of that route (5.7), and belay.  From the anchor, continue up 20' to the weakness in the steep right wall of the Book.  After making a reachy clip, unleash the fury and perform a burly hand traverse on decent holds past two more bolts before rocking up onto an exposed perch on the arete.Belay here off bolts and either continue with the final 5.10a pitch of Animal Boy or lower/rap back to the first anchor of the Great Red Book.  One more 100' rap takes you to the ground.This project was envisioned, equipped, and graciously opened by Josh Thompson.# Location
# Protection
A light rack for the Great Red Book and three draws (optional 0.5 Camalot with a long sling protects making the first clip).
