# Description
A great moderate route with a small amount of gear. This climb ascends the right-end of the observatory, climbing the blunt low-angled formation more or less over the right side of the main feature of the observatory. This climb finished below the 'eye of the cyclops', if you will but with enough rope and maybe a little simul-climbing, can be completed to the top.The grade felt significantly harder than the 5.3 grade given by Swain in his books.# Location
Although there is supposedly an anchor from which to retreat, we climbed the whole formation and walked/scrambled back off to the SE and then back to the base.# Protection
A few bolts. You WILL BE run out.
