# Description
Begins at the second left-facing flake, 5 feet right of Haunted Hooks.  Stick clipping the first bolt is recommended, as the spot from which you clip it has a slopey and somewhat sandy foot position, and I've seen someone unexpectedly come off there.  Great Red Rocks face climbing up 7 bolts through 2 cruxes.  One of the best routes on the wall!# Location
The third route on the wall from the entrance, 5 feet past Haunted Hooks.# Protection
7 draws and a couple more for the anchor.
