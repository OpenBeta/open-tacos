# Description
The furthest right climb on the wall.  The start involves a little weirdness, and it just continues, all the way up.  Climb up lower angle rock to a large dish.  Pull the dish on the left (awkward!) and continue up to anchors.# Location
last route on the Stone Wall.# Protection
6 bolts plus whatever you like to put on bolted anchors
