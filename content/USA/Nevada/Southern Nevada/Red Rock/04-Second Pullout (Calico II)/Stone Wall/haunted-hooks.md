# Description
Start at a left-facing flake underneath huecos.  The beginning is somewhat reachy for the vertically challanged and requires a little ingenuity.  Then things thin out and get a little cruxy before reaching the anchors.# Location
This is the second route from the entrance on the wall.# Protection
9 draws and some anchor building goodness.
