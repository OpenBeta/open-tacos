# Description
Loose, not very well protected climbing. Very soft rock in a few places. Start up a protectable crack a few feet right of Keep It Gutta and place everything you can, turn the roof on the right and try not to bring the house of cards down on yourself. Gear anchor in the cave, head left (thin pro available) to anchor of KIG to rappel, or walk off.# Location
Far right route as of now on Jane's main wall. There was a small plaque in place we found reading "5.8 R fun" at the base.# Protection
Took gear to #2 camalot. Much of the gear seemed questionable.
