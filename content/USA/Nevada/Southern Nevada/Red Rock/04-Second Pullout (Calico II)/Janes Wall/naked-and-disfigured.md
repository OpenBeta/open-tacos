# Description
This gem of a climb is often overlooked due to the classic status of its neighbor Pigs in Zen.  However, this route is just as good.Start by heading up the slab with a right slanting crack (a #1 camalot can be useful here to take the edge off of getting to the high first bolt). Once getting the first bolt clipped, the climb is in your face.  A few sequences involving big, powerful moves will see you through the first three bolts.  At the third bolt, catch a shake at the jug, and prepare for some smaller holds and technical movement. The run from the last bolt to the anchors looks long, but the climbing begins to ease here.# Location
On the main Jane's wall this route is 3rd from the right, 2nd from the left.# Protection
5 bolts to chains.  A #1 camalot is helpful to get to the first bolt.
