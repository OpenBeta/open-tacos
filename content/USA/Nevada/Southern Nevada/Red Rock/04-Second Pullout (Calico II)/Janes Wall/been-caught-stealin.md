# Description
A fun chunk of varnish I spotted while checking out the new lines on the smaller of the two Jane's walls. Some powerful moves but the rock quality, movement, and positive holds on this one are really good. The name derives from a combination of one of Janes's Addiction's best songs and some mild controversy about the FA.# Location
Takes steep dark rock between Mannish Boys and the two 10s on the right. Begin by laybacking up a corner on hollow rock.# Protection
4 Stainless bolts and hangers, all placed on lead, no hooks, no chalk, no previewing, no bullshit (til after the FA, anyway) Stainless ring anchor hangers up top allow a more pleasant finish to the leftmost of the two 5.10s to the right of the route as well, avoiding the odd and awkward traverse that I've seen people swearing on.
