# Description
Easy crack system left of Half Baked, put up solo and all known repeats have been in the same style. A fun scramble with mostly solid rock, and probably a good thing to put a kid or new climber on if you've dragged them up this far already. Standard rack will probably suffice.# Location
Left of Half Baked on smaller of the two Janes's walls. Furthest left line on the wall.# Protection
