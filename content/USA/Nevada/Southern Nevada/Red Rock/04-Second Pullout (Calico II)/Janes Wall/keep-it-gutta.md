# Description
Fun mixed line just right of See Dick Fly. Takes an engaging, well proctected face with a crack running through it to a steeper head wall and crux climbing. This route, like all established by our group, was established ground up, without chalk, no previewing, and no hooks.# Location
In the corridor on the far right side of the main wall, just right ofSee Dick Flyand left ofJay Smith Appreciation Route.# Protection
A set of wires and cams to .75" is all you'll need for gear. Rappel anchor in place on top.
