# Description
This route is super fun, albeit it might prove a bit too spicy for some in the upper crux. Suspect there may often be a leaver biner on the 5th bolt.Make burly moves past two bolts(stick clipping 1st bolt is recommended). Climb up to base of upper head wall, (use a long sling or at minimum a long draw on 4th bolt)Make technical and challenging moves up the head wall to easier finish to the anchor# Location
20' left of "Holiday 12a", Starts at the base of a shallow crack\groove.# Protection
6 bolts and anchors, (all glue in bolts with Pig Tail Lower offs)
