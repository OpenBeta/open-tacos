# Description
Super fun moves with lots of opportunity for trick moves\techniques. Some may find it easy for the grade, some may not. The route could seem 11d, (or easier) for the tall and bouldering strong, my grading is after all, "provisional" ;-)# Location
30 feet left of California 12a, steep over-hanging vertical grooves.# Protection
4 bolts, anchors (all glue in bolts and Pig Tail Lower Offs)
