# Description
My Favorite of the routes on this wall! Make powerful moves right out of the gate! Move up past a tricky section at a horizontal crack, and on up to a sloping ledge! A technical crux up a steep section of wall leads up onto another sloping ledge. Move up right onto a small pillar, (hidden holds make this section much easier), Super fun technical moves up a shallow corner lead to a short run to the anchor!# Location
20 + feet left of "T.R.Q." Starts with the overhang at your chest, where the ground\ledge slopes steeply down to the left.# Protection
13 bolts and anchors, all glue in bolts with Pig Tail lower offs. This route is well protected, with the moderate leader in mind, (but there is a bit of spice at the top to keep the more advanced leaders psyched)
