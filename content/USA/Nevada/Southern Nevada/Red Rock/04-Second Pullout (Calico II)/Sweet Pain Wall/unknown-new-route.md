# Description
2 new routes to the far right of the Sweet Pain wall.  They're not in Jerry Handren's guidebook, or here on mountainproject.com.The second from the far right is probably 5.7.  Lots of holds, great beginner route.  The holds are still a bit friable as the route is new.  Well bolted except for a bit of easy runout at the top.  Crux is getting to the first bolt but it's 5.7 max.We didn't do the first but guessed it would go at 5.9 or so, and it has it's own set of anchors at the top.  However those are not rap anchors and do not have chains.  You'd likely have to leave something up there to pull your rope through it.If the folks that put this up would like to add comments, and route names, that would be great!# Location
Second bolted route from the far right, on Sweet Pain wall.# Protection
There are anchor chains at the top, however the left anchor is already loose (the bolt moves inside the hole despite tightening the nut).
