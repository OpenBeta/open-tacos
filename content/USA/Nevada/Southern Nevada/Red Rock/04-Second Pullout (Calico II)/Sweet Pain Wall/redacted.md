# Description
Immediately right ofGlitter Gulch, Slave to the Grind starts with a long reach to a rail.  Steep face climbing with a tricky crux around the third bolt.  Climbing eases towards the top.  Although given an 11b rating in the Brock guidebook, I felt it to be closer to 11c.# Location
# Protection
7 bolts to 2-bolt anchor.
