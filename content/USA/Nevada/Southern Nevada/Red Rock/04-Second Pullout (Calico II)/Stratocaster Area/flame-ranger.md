# Description
A classic line that almost no one ever climbs because you need a little gear for the intial crack at the bottom. The upper 3/4 of the route is bolted although slightly runout and very pumpy# Location
The varnished wall just to the left of the first gully you cross on your way to the Stratocaster wall. About 200-300 yars past Running Man.# Protection
Acouple of small to medium stoppers and maybe a .3 camalot for the crack. Anchor at the top. A 70 meter rope is advisable. You might make it down if your 60 is a little long.
