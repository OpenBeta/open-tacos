# Description
This thing gets my vote for the best 5.10 sport climb in Red Rock.  Super long, technical and sustained, this route seems to go on forever.The first two thirds of the route features vertical climbing with postive edges.  Once at the top third, the angle eases back, but the difficulty does not.  Technical footwork up the lower angled rock will see you to the chains.# Location
This route is located on the tall black wall before the Stratocaster area proper.  It is the leftmost route on the wall, just left of Flame Ranger.# Protection
13! bolts, chains
