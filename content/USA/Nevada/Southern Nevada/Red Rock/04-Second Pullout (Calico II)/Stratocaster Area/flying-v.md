# Description
This interesting “adventure” sport route starts by climbing out of a chimney for maybe 25 feet of unprotected slab to the first bolt.  Follow the bolts above to a three-bolt anchor.  As of this writing, two biners offer a quick lower off, but one of them is on a bolt sticking about a quarter inch out of the rock; be prepared to deal with it.  Rated 11b in Handren (II), the route is at least now at the high end of the 11 range (IMO) due, I suspect, to holds popping off (we had a key one blow).  Suspect rock remains, but worth a go if all the other decent 11s in the area are booked – some cool movement, and the crux is super well protected and short.  Name and FA info from Handren.# Location
This is the next bolted route about 40 feet right ofFootloose.  Reach the base by scrambling up a short v-slot to a nice, sheltered ledge.# Protection
