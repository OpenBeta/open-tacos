# Description
An okay route that has some exhilarating steepness!  There is an asterisks though - the route still has quite a bit of loose rock, especially near the top, and possibly (although I am not certain) the first few pockets on the initial overhang are drilled?  The route is energetic and fun and if cleaned a bit more could be very popular!# Location
Begin on the loose-looking slab to the right of Choad Warrior.# Protection
