# Description
Start in the corner just to the right of the steep direct start. This used to require trad gear/traversing to get to the bolts higher up but has since been fully bolted and follows a direct line all the way up. Extending some of the lower draws seemed useful but rope drag should be manageable without. A 70 meter rope will get you back down fine - and as always, please don't TR directly through the anchor. The upper bolts have permadraws as of Feb 2021.Compared to other sport routes in RR this thing is a worthwhile saga. The sandy nature of the holds add to the overall experience, but hopefully they clean up with time.# Location
Climbs the prominent arete on the right hand side of the Stratocaster Wall. Starting in a corner to the right or on Stratocaster Direct.# Protection
Bolts and bolted anchor if using the Direct start, otherwise gear is needed for the first pitch.
