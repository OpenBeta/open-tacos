# Description
Enough people get on the lower part of Choad Warrior that I figured I'd put this in as an option for folks.The first half of Choad Warrior. Stick clip the high first draw and boulder through juggy holds to a thin face above. Clip four more bolts, working your way through a cryptic crux involving an annoying lack of feet and iffy holds. Clip the chains and celebrate or mantle onto the shelf to continue on the full Choad.# Location
On the main Stratocaster wall, third route in from the left- the obvious hueco'ed overhang above marks the route. juggy start to a vertical face with lots of chalk, and in-situ draws above the anchor for the full line (12+).# Protection
5 glue-in bolts to mussy and chain draw anchor
