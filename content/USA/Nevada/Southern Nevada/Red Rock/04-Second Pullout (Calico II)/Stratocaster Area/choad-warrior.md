# Description
A beautiful line that moves up through an overhang and up a thin face to a ledge, then up a very steep wall (bouldery) to the headwall and the anchors. (It's .12a to the first set of anchors and the ledge)# Location
Located about 150' left of Stratocaster, this is the obvious route on the left side of the Stratocaster Wall proper.# Protection
