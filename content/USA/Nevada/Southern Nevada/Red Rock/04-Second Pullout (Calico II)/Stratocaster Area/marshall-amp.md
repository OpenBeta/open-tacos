# Description
A nice long route on mostly huge holds. Unadulterated fun. This climb starts up the second big cave/roof at the Stratocaster area and goes up and left to bypass the roof on good holds, then up a hugely huecoed face on huge holds (with a few huge moves) to reach a fixed anchor. Swain's book suggests rapping with 2 ropes, but I recall lowering off and TRing my partner with a single 70M rope.# Location
This climb is the OBVIOUS hueco and jug system starting up the left side of the main stratocaster cave, perhaps 50M past Cut Loose and 30M past Foot Loose. a few minutes South of Running man wall.  This is a bit to the left a short bit of the area's namesake climb 'Stratocaster'# Protection
10 draws.
