# Description
Beyond Reason is a very powerful route, but not as hard as Monster Skank.  A few of the bolts are old ring bolts and look a bit weird (scary).  Begin by climbing some powerful crimps and then through a long throw to a good left leaning rail.  Then traverse a little left and into the (what I felt was) the redpoint crux.  It's a very fun and energetic route, but a few holds up high felt a little hollow.# Location
First route on the wall right of Stratocaster Direct's big chimney.  Usually some stacked rocks at the start.# Protection
Bolts.  Probably want to stick clip the first two bolts.
