# Description

After you pass the test climb the continuous deep squeeze chimney that is hard to protect but also quite fun.# Location
The right most crack that forms the "triad".# Protection
a few hand sized, large cams, and/or a few bros, stoppers, helmet for belayer.Descent: This route can be rapped with a 70M off a slung block and nut.
