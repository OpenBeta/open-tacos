# Description
Vegabondage lives on a white wall just around the corner at the Triad. It is the not-so-splitter finger crack going up the featured wall. The crack has occasionally good jams but the rock is flakey and soft and if you weigh more than a mouse you'll probably break something off. In a way, it is a fun top ropeÂ… but not obvious to set up. I suspect this route has been lead very few times and it was likely pretty bold.# Location
