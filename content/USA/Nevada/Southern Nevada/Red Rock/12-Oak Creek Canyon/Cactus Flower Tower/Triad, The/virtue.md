# Description
Virtue is another long pitch at the Triad and is the left most corner crack. It is easily distinguished by the splitter crack with a wide pod near the top of the route.  The lower half of the route is a little sandy, but the quality increases with height.  The splitter fist crack/wide pod up high is the highlight of the climb and is engaging for the grade.Please note!  A 70m rope is not sufficient for getting down.   Either commit to doing some down climbing or rappel to the bushy ledge above Vegabondage and do another rappel to the ground. This route finishes on the same large ledge system as Beauty, etc. but is tucked away to the left and scrambling through bushes would be required to traverse over to top Beauty, not preferred.# Location
