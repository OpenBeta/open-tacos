# Description
This seldom climbed splitter squeeze is a true joy for the wide enthusiast. Beauty has been described as one of the harder free climbs of the Herbst era and is quite strenuous and run out. This climb is committing, and might have you questioning your sanity, among other things of questionable importance.On this route you will encounter an offwidth crack that leads to a tight squeeze chimney which gradually widens.  Be prepared to clip an ancient bolt then plug a Big Bro and run it out for 20ish feet of great squeeze climbing.  Once at the top kiss and lower off a slung tree with a 70m.# Location
The striking central crack at The Triad.# Protection
#5 and #6 cam, #4 and #5 Bro, a small/medium nut or two, prayer book of choice, and a helmet for the belayer (recommended).
