# Description
The Forgotten is a mostly clean cut hand crack that teeters from fragile to awesome and back to okay again.  The "main attraction" is the overhanging splitter that is of excellent quality.  There are two options to get to the main splitter 1) The left arching hand/fist crack that is guarded by lots of loose rock and features initially poor protection and some breakable handholds. or 2) Partially climbing Wisdom then traversing right to the overhanging hand crack.   The choice is yours...# Location
Hand crack just to the right of Wisdom.# Protection
Single Rack fingers to fist, doubles #1 - #3 BD, more #3 if you do the arching crack start.Rappel with a 70M off the same slung/fixed anchor as for Wisdom or continue up the unprotected chimney above potentially gaining/downclimbing to the anchor gully for Beauty.
