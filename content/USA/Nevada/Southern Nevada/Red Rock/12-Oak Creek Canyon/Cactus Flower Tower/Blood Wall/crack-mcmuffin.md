# Description
On the cliff bands below the Blood Wall there is a varnished face split by a crack.  Climb the crack straight up to a pine tree at its top.The obvious descent is to scramble left (east) and do a short rappel into the tiny canyon leading back to the base of the route.# Location
Walk up the Oak Creek trail, passing beneath the Solar Slab, and drop into the streambed.  Go upstream to a point where some brushy third class leads up and left (south) to a ramp system going back toward the road.  When you are beneath the route, climb up a 150' fourth-class slab.  People less cowardly than myself may scamper up this section with no thoughts about next-of-kin, but we roped up for the ascent.  Having just a single rope, we descended this section by down-leading, which seemed like a reasonable compromise.# Protection
Standard rack
