# Description
This is the extension to the short route called Glass Half Empty. It effectively doubles the length of that route, adding some fantastic climbing with no real increase in difficulty. Fully bolted, but bring a medium stopper (I used a BD #9) to tame a run out between the first and second bolts of the extension.Begin with very thin climbing (crux fingerlock-pinch at the fourth bolt) and continue past the anchor through some beautiful varnish and somewhat sporty bolt spacing to a shared anchor with Bad Blood. The final bolt is equipped so as to help with cleaning the pitch.NB: Be gentle yarding on the righthand undercling flake at the start.# Location
# Protection
12-13x draws and a medium (#9 BD) stopper. 70m rope to get down.
