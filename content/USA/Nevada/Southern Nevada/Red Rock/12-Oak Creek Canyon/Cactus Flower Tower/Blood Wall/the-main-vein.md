# Description
A killer route. The bottom is bolted and the top is a tricky seam/offset. Good gear abounds but it seemed like it was always hard to place. The grade must come from the toprope because this seems miles harder than the routes at the Sunnyside wall.# Location
Found on the left-hand side of the Blood Wall, it takes the center weakness up the patch of varnish. The approach is horrible but this route delivers. Starts in a short flake. There are four routes here with bolts; from the left, this is the third route.# Protection
Plentiful, but intricate. 5 botls, micro cams up to .75 C4 (I took doubles), wires and offset wires. There was a place for a bigger cam up high, but there was other, less obvious stuff around. Wires were very helpful. Bolted anchor.
