# Description
Bad Blood is a great mixed line at the left end of the Blood Wall. It kicks off with a comical boulder problem moving past a pocket and then continues up a varnished face, traversing rightwards on great rock before continuing up to a high anchor.The route climbs through a few mossy patches but the essential holds are clean... it's only a bit of friable rock in spots up high that keep me from giving this three stars. Were it not for the start it would be a great warmup for the harder climbs on the wall (still, you could easily aid through this start if necessary).Mostly bolted, but have a single set of cams to 0.5 Camalot and optional medium wire as well.# Location
Begin at the left end of the main Blood Wall, starting on top of two large red cheater-stones. The FA was done without these, but it's a slightly better route with them. The cool pocket that marks the start is obvious.# Protection
A dozen draws, a few long slings, and a single set of cams from tiny to 0.5 Camalot. A medium wire is helpful. A full 70m rope - watch your ends carefully, you can barely lower off with a 70 and stretch.
