# Description
Start on the right (western) side of the right half of the Blood Wall, immediately to the right of an obvious left-facing corner.  A long, sustained pitch leads to a belay alcove beneath a polished wall.  The second pitch goes past the polished headwall, through a bush or two, then up a slickly varnished, left-leaning crack.  The third pitch follows the world's friendliest offwidth (5.0) to more broken ground.  Fourth class leads to the top.For the descent, scramble down the Cactus Flower Tower west ridge route.There is some good climbing on this route, but it is somewhat offset by occasional battles with hostile shrubbery.# Location
Scramble up the Blood Wall approach until you can move right (west) to the base of the route.# Protection
Std rack w/ small cams.  Maybe a big cam for the easy offwidth
