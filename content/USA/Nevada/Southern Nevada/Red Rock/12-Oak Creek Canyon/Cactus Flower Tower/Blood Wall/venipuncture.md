# Description
Another great route. Well protected face climbing with an uncharacteristic runout towards the top. Start on the Main Vein, but make big moves out left to continue up a bolt line with a few supplemental gear placements. The crux is up high.# Location
On the patch of varnish on the upper, left-hand portion of the Blood Wall. Of the four routes with bolts, this is the 2nd route from the left.# Protection
7 bolts and cams/wires to 0.5 C4. Bolted anchor.
