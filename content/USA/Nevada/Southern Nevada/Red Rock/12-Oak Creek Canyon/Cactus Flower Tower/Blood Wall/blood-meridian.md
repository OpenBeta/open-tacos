# Description
Blood Meridian is a fun route up nearly perfect rock on the right side of the upper tier of the Blood Wall. The route breaks down into three sections separated by good rests: First warmup 5.10Â climbing through huecos to escape some lichen to a ledge. Then, cruxy climbing passing three bolts to a dramatic finish and a good recovery stance. And finally, great 5.11- climbing with spaced but bomber gear up twin seams to a high anchor.Be it climbed for it's own sake or as a warmup for Venipuncture or the Main Vein, this route is a gem.# Location
Climbs the narrow panel of nice rock between Seppuku and OW Negative.# Protection
