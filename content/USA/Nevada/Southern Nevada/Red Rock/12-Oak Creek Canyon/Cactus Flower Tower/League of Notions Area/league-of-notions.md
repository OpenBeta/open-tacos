# Description
This route sits low on the East Face of Cactus Flower Tower. Joanne Urioste observes in the Red Book that while standing at the mouth of Oak Creek Canyon (say, at the intersection of Oak Creek Trail and Knoll Trail), the line of League of Notions sits on the plumb line from the top of the Mount Wilson summit.Approach by hiking up the ridge line that is on the left side and parallel to the drainage below the climb. Once through the pink cliff band, you'll need to contour right to the base of the climb.Pitch 1: Ascend the dihedral. Build an anchor at some bushes to the right. There are slings here for rappelling.Pitch 2: Go to the right and down, traverse the face on thin holds to the next crack. Little pro.Pitch 3: climb up the chimney and off-width through the roof and up the finger crack.Rappel the route with two ropes.# Location
