# Description
Scramble a long way up the approach gully near Ramen Pride, generally bearing to the right.  When you reach the crest of the main buttress, climb up on varied 5th class rock for several pitches.  Eventually you come out on a broad wooded ledge beneath the main headwall.  Climb a right-facing ramp system behind a large, gnarled pine tree.  The second headwall pitch climbs a crack system directly above a second big pine.  When the cracks peter out, wander up and right to the summit.An alternative start bypasses a few of the broken lower pitches.  Scramble up to the base of the Blood Wall, then continue up and left (east).  This is mostly class 2 with one fifth class spot.  You join the longer route one pitch beneath the wooded ledge system.Descent: this route ends at the Cactus Flower Tower summit, so follow the standard descent along the west ridge.# Location
