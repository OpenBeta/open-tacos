# Description
The Warrior is a very adventurous and unknown classic. It involves every type of crack climbing there is. Giving too much info will ruin the adventure aspect of the route so I'll keep it brief. Follow the huge dihedral on the north side of Cactus flower tower for five pitches, the last two go straight up the face. Rap the route to descend (two ropes required).I hope you enjoy this seldom-climbed classic!PS. This is less like Red rocks 5.11 and more like yosemite 5.11# Location
