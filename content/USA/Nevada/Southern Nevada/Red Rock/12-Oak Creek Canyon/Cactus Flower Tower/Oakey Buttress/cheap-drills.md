# Description
From the slabs at the base of the wall, scramble all the way left on exposed 4th class terrain to a bolted belay station overlooking a big drop.  Start here and climb straight upward, following thin cracks.  Eventually, bear right and climb up to another bolted belay station.  The second pitch goes up and slightly left until you can move back right on a rounded rib in the white rock.  This will take you to a hand crack and the summit.  There is a third bolted station next to the handcrack on the top of the formation.# Location
Follow the normal approach to the western end of the buttress, then cross to the eastern end of the apron area at the base of the wall.# Protection
