# Description
This is probably the line that Harrington and Overholtz referred to as a "super-forgettable grovel," but it is really not so bad.  Climb up the gradually steepening crack system and belay above a small overhang.  The second pitch follows thin cracks through the white rock to a wide ledge with some large bushes.  The third pitch goes up and right (with possible variations) to another ledge to the right of a big corner system.  Easier climbing leads to the top.# Location
Approach as you would for the Blood Wall, but stop before reaching the gully/chimney at the start of Hypertension.  There is a poorly defined sloping buttress to the left of a varnished expanse.  Begin in the crack system immediately to the left of a right-facing, right-slanting corner.# Protection
