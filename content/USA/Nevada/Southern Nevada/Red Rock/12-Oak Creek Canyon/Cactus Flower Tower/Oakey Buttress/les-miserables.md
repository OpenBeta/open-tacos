# Description
On the right side of the Oakey Buttress, the formation is cleaved at the top by a gully, that becomes a chimney, that becomes a water-worn groove, and finally peters out half way down the cliff.  Climb the dirty, loose, and not-very-pleasant cracks beneath the groove, then follow the chimney to the top.# Location
