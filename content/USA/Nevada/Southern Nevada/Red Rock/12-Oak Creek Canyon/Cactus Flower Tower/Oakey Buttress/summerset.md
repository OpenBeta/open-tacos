# Description
Midway between Tres Bon and Les Miserables, there is a faint, ramp-like weakness running up and right on the varnished face.  It leads generally to the right-hand of the two parallel cracks in the upper white wall.  Follow this to a gear belay.  The second pitch continues straight to a crack on the white face.  When this crack peters out, move left to join the upper jam crack on Tres Bon.# Location
