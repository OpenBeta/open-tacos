# Description
Start at the same point as Cheap Drills, but follow thin cracks that slant up and to the right.  Set up a gear belay beneath a small bulge.  The second pitch goes straight up via thin crack, friction, and ultimately hand jams in the left-hand of the two parallel cracks in the upper wall.# Location
