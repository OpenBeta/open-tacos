# Description
Dihedral leading to face, then a seam with a few 1-2 finger pods. Face holds are crucial. At 5'6" I had to lunge to a great crimp where my taller partner had an easier time. Rock right under the anchor is flaky. (Tap on holds, notify belayer, wear helmets)70m definitely reaches. I feel like 60m should reach, but may be close.We TR'd off the 2 bolt anchor reached on "some handcrack."There is opportunity for lots of small nuts in the seam if one wanted to lead it.No idea who the FA belongs to, no idea what they call it, no idea what they want it graded.# Location
About 90ft left of the start of Solar Flare. Or about 10' right of "some handcrack."# Protection
Small nuts and cams?
