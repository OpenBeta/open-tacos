# Description
Approach as per Solar Slab Gully.  The start of Johnny Vegas is just to the left (when facing the wall), behind a boulder perched on a short pedestal of rock.p1.  Start up the double cracks, which eventually become a single crack.  As the protection starts to become sparser, trend up and left.  Belay at a bolted anchor on a platform at the base of a short dark dihedral.  A long pitch.p2.  Stem up the dihedral to gain a face with some questionable rock.  Continue up and slightly right to another bolted belay, below the base of a right-facing dihedral capped by a roof.p3.  Head up and right on the easy but run out slab, and continue up, and around the corner.  The pro is better once around the corner.  The crux route-finding is deciding when to surmount the apex of the face and start trending back to the left.  It's easy to come up to slabby ground and find yourself above the belay/rappel anchor.p4.  Head up easy climbing to the boulders near the edge of the main Solar Slab Terrace, and continue scrambling up to the base of Solar Slab if so desired.With the exception of p4, all of the pitches felt like they had some 5.6 climbing, and some friable rock.Rappel from the top of p3 with two ropes (or if you only have one rope, head down Solar Slab Gully).# Location
