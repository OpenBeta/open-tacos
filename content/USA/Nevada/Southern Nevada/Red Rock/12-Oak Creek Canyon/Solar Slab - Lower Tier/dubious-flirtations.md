# Description
Dubious Flirtations has a nice variation of climbing, some spice, and a touch of adventure.  It is located the left side of the Solar Wall, in a small alcove just to the left of the Sunburn Buttress.  In the alcove, there is a small varnished face split by a razor thin crack rising from the right side of a very clean, rectangular ceiling.  The route starts in the corner leading up to this crack.Move up to a short but wide left-facing corner on face holds and blocks.  Continue up the wide corner (number 4 camalot) through the small roof and onto the fingercrack spitting the face.  Climb the fingercrack until it seals up.  Move out right on face holds to a chimney system and stance.  5.10b/c Belay takes 1"-3"At this point, you can move right and up (careful for loose rock!) to a rappel from a pine tree next to the second belay on Sunburn Buttress, or continue upward on that route.# Location
To approach, aim for a large roof feature on the left side of the Solar wall.  Once you reach the wall traverse left until you see a short left-facing corner that leads to a nice fingercrack splitting a black face.# Protection
Standard rack to #4 camalot.  Don't forget smaller cams.
