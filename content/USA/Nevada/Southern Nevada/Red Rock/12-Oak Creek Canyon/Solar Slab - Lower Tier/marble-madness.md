# Description
At least 3 pitches.  3rd anchor is ~30' left of the Solar Flare P4 anchor (the traverse looked protectable).P1 is just under 35m, P2 & P3 looked 30-40m each.P2 and P3 looked mostly easy, P1 is 5.10.  The roof 30m off the ground felt very similar to the adjacent Solar Flare roof.PG13 is my guess w/o actually trying to lead. Could be R for all I know.    1st bolt is ~30' off the ground.(sorry for adding a route w/o complete info but it looks to be at least 3 years old, and waiting for a proper ascent may take a while)# Location
Right where the trail to Solar Flare hits the wall.# Protection
Some bolts, occasional gear, not sure if enough to lead safely.
