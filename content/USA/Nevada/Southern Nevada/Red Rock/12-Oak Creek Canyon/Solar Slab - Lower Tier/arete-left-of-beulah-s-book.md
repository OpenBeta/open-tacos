# Description
Pitch 1: Start at the base of Beulah's Book. Continue left and up the face ramp below the continuing arete and face left of the classic chimney dihedral known as the Beulah's Book line. One long 65 meter pitch places you above the bolted arete at a two bolt belay station. Pitch 2: Continue up on the face past intermittent cracks and a sea of small jugs. This second pitch, finishes as a full 70 meter line that ends with establishing an anchor system on a few angling cracks. Feel free to provide and submit more information.# Location
