# Description
This is a great route with varied climbing.  Approach as for Solar Slab Gully, but head left and along a ledge system before reaching the base of the gully.  Squeeze past a couple of trees to the base of the first pitch.P1- (5.6) Go up a short dihedral and step left at a chockstone.  Continue up past a bolt and up the face to a nice belay ledge below the chimney.  It also looked possible to step into an easy chimney shortly after the bolt which leads to the same belay ledge.P2- Enter the obvious chimney and climb up past a bolt (5.9).  Exit the chimney, and head up the great dihedral above (5.9).  Step left at the top to a two bolt belay.P3- Climb up and right across the slab above (5.5 no pro) and continue up through intermittent cracks to the large terrace below Solar Slab.  This pitch was a full 60m.Either descend Solar Slab Gully from here or finish the day on Solar Slab.# Location
