# Description
About 30' to the right of Solar Flare, climb a clean, left-facing corner.  When the corner gets too smooth, make a delicate step left.  There is a bolted anchor a short distance above the overhang.  It is possible to move left below the overhang and join the easy crack leading to the second belay on Solar Flare.# Location
