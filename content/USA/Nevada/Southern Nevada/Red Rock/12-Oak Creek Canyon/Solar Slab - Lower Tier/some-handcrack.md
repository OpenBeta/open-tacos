# Description
Hand / wide hand / fist crack. Goes up to a 2 bolt anchor with chains. 70m rope reached the ground with some leftover, not absolutely sure a 60m would, but I think it's likely. Length is an estimate.Route is pretty straightforward. Just be wary at the softer rock and flakes near the anchors. (Be sure your belayer knows, wear helmets)We used a single rack to BD #4 as that's what we already had, but multiples in #3 would be better and then no need for the #4.Placeholder name since I don't know who put it up, what it's called, and what they would like it to be graded.Also can TR the harder finger crack / seam to the right from the same anchor. (Continue to be wary of the soft flaky rock up high)# Location
About 100' to the left of the start to Solar Flare.# Protection
