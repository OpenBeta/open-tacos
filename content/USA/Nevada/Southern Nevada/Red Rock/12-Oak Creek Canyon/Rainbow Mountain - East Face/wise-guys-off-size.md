# Description
Wise Guys Off Size is a burly squeeze climb that only Joe Herbst could have dreamed up. A long voyage that gradually narrows on good rock.# Location
The right most route on the wall.  Wise Guys is the left leaning splitter squeeze and offwidth.  Easily spotted from the trail in advance.  Scramble up bushy ledges to the left to gain the main ledge which accesses Tickled Pink, Beelzebub, and Wise Guys.# Protection
Many big bros, large cams, or both. A few small/medium pieces for the start.
