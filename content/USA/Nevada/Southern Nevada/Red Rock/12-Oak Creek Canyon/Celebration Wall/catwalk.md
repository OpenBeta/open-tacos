# Description
This route ascends an obvius crack system in upper Oak Creek Canyon.Approach: Ascent Oak Creek until large pine trees are reached.  The route can be seen on the right (sunny) side of the canyon and follows a prominant left slanting crack system.Pitch 1: Scramble up and right up easy slabs to attain the lower reaches of the crack system.  Belay in the crack below some small overhangs.Pitches 2 - 6: Follow the crack, with occasional hanging belays, upward to the base of a steep wall.Pitch 7: Follow smaller cracks in the wall through excellent rock to the summit.  Cautious climbers may want to stay roped up for another pitch.Descent: Work left to slabs leading to the head of Oak Creek and then down to the base of the route.  A very easy descent by Vegas standards.  After the first pitch we saw no fixed anchors at all; retreat would be difficult.Notes: Pitches 1 - 3 contain some fairly serious runouts at the 5.4 level.  This is not a good route for a 5.6 leader!  The rock on the lower part of the route is not the best either.  The best climbing is the headwall at the top of the route - an excellent pitch.Routefinding is not a problem - once you settle into the crack system things are quite obvious.  The Red Book mentions an easier alternative to the final pitch on the right.A very long approach for a climb with only a few really good pitches.# Location
