# Description
This route climbs the left facing corner to the left of the OW roof crack of Xyphoid Fever.Begin as for Xyphoid Fever up blocky terrain onto a ledge. From here climb straight up via good jams. Be careful of some loose blocks down low. Follow this to the roof. At the roof cut around the left side and into the left facing corner and crack. Good jams will bring you to the top of the corner where some funky maneuvering and face holds will see you out of the corner and up. A large block just below a wide flare is slung with a rap ring on it- anchor here or climb up further to another bolt and fixed nut anchor.To descend, rappel the route.# Location
