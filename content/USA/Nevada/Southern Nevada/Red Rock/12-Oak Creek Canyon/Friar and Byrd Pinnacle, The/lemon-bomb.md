# Description
The first pitch had been done years ago but the second is quite stout, strenuous and a real battle to protect. The full route is called Lemon Bomb, 170 ft 5.11d. Start as forRed Zingerat the base of the deep left facing corner.1. 90 ft 5.9 Layback up the wide flake to the left of the main corner. Continue up the thinner cracks above to an anchor on a ledge.2. 80 ft 5.11d Continue up the tips crack into an awkward flare. Above the flare an easier fist crack leads to a ledge on the right with an anchor.(Admin note: Apparently some sources incorrectly identify this route as "The A Crack," but the actual A Crack is really about 150 yards to the right ofRed Zingerdown and around the corner on the right side of the Byrd Pinnacle.)# Location
# Protection
Single set of cams from #00 tcu to #4 camalot, rp's, wires, a really big cam (9 inches?) might make the flare on pitch 2 less bold.
