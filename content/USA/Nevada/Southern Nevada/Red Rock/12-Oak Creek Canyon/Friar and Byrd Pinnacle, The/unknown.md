# Description
Just to the left of Red Zinger is a bolted 5.13a tips corner.  Just to the right of this corner is a shallow offwidth with a finger crack in the back of it.  Climb this offwidth until you are level with the anchors atop the bolted route and traverse left to those anchors.  The crux of the route is placing gear as it's hard to see into the crack to place it.# Location
between Lemon Bomb and Feather (the bolted sport route).# Protection
Small nuts to finger sized pieces.
