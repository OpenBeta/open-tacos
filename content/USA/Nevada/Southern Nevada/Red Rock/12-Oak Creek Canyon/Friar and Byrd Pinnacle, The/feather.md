# Description
This is an ultra thin bolted tips crack to the left of Red Zinger.  The crux is encountered between the first and second bolts as you try to get your left foot established on the left face of the dihedral.  After that it's continuous thin tips liebacking with a few crimps on the right hand wall until after the last bolt when you get some decent holds to get you to the anchor.# Location
This route is about 15 feet left of Red Zinger and 4 feet right of Trim.# Protection
4 bolts to a 2 ring anchor
