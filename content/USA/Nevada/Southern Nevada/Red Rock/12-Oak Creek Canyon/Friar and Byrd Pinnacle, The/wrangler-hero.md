# Description
It's hard to imagine this route hadn't been previously climbed given how easy it is to get to but it's not listed anywhere and several of the starting holds broke off under body weight when we first tried it.Pull a small roof into a short but rad hand crack that leads to a finger crack in a right facing corner. The first body length or so has some bad rock but the rest is quite good.# Location
The climb is located on an uninspiring looking cliff below Byrd Pinnacle.  Gear anchor and an easy walk off at the top.# Protection
Single rack to 2" with an extra hand piece or two.
