# Description
This route ascends the obvious finger crack about five feet to the left of the bolted sport route, and about 20 feet to the left of Red Zinger.  Supposedly the route goes at 5.12b, but It felt much harder than that to me (probably my lack of overhanging finger crack with no feet technique).  The crux is encountered about 3/4 of the way up when the crack kicks back a few degrees beyond vertical, and the feet run out.  After the crux, traverse right to the anchors of the bolted sport route.# Location
Just left of the Feather, the bolted sport route that is just left of Red Zinger.# Protection
Finger sized pieces.
