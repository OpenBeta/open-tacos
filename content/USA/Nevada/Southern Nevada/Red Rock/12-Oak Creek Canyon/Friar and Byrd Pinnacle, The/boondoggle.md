# Description
This takes on the flaring roof crack directly above the Red Zinger dihedral. Instead of traversing left at the nut/sling belay below the roof, continue straight out the wideness. The usual two-bolt anchor on top will get you down with 1 60m rope. This is a pretty unique pitch for red rock requiring some real crack moves. Enjoy.# Location
This is the direct finish to Red Zinger.# Protection
the usual gear for red zinger, but add an old 5 camalot, and a 5 and 6 friend.
