# Description
This is harder than it looks and there is an incredibly dangerous boulder teetering on the ledge at about 60',  just above the first greyish roof. One can exit right to finish on top of Byrd Pinnacle at this point, which is how we found out how loose the block is. It would be soooo easy to tip this thing off, but it would wipe out the tree below as well as alot of other unexpected results. Be careful if you go by this thing! And don't park underneath for the day! It really felt like the wind could dislodge it! I leaned against it while belaying my partner for the next section up the route and it swayed dramatically. Very scary!# Location
Very left side of Byrd Pinnacle.# Protection
Standard rack plus something big for the upper chimney, like a #5 cam, which we didn't have.
