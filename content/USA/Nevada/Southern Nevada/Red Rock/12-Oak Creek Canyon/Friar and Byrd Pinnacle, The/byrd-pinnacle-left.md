# Description
This is the attractive set of double cracks on the left side of the formation, leading up through varnished rock to a crack slanting up and right to the finish. Rated 7+ in Handren's guide, we'd kick it up to  a solid 8 but you decide. Very good pitch.# Location
Byrd Pinnacle is down and right of Red Zinger, across the gully from the Friar and easy to spot as one walks into the mouth of Oak Creek. The striking off-width  crack through the roof right of this route, named Xyphoid Fever, is a good landmark.# Protection
Good pro readily available. As per Handren's suggested rack.
