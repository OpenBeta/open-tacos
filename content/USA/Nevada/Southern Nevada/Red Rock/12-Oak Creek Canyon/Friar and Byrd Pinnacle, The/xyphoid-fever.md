# Description
This route climbs the obvious offwidth roof about 100' up on the crag. Named for the uniqueness of the climbing- this is one of joe's neater little gems out there.# Location
Middle of Byrd Pinnacle, rap from the bolted anchor above the roof, one rope, i believe.# Protection
Standard rack- bring a #4 camalot or two, maybe a #5 (C4) for the roof.
