# Description
To the right of the Solar Slab is a large, complex, broken face.  Its right edge is the southeast ridge of the east peak of Rainbow Mountain.  Skyline goes up this ridge, staying to the right of the long gully.  There is a lot of class 3 climbing; we belayed on only about 8 pitches.  The primary challenge is routefinding, so study the peak before launching.# Location
