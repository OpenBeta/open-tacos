# Description
Going Nuts is a spectacular little route on the upper tier of the Solar Slab Wall.  It is also an excellent way to pass slow parties on Solar Slab proper.The route can be found in a dark corner on the far left hand side of the Solar Slab Wall.Pitch One:Climb the obvious crack up into a band of broken black rock.  Build a belay shortly after the crack runs out on at a small stance.  The name of the route is probably derived from the fact that most of the potential belay stances require one to use nuts for an anchor.Pitch Two:Continue up and left.  Be aware that some of the black rock is loose.  Climb up to the large ledge that makes up the top of the arch on Solar Slab Wall.  Belay from here.Descent:Walk across the large ledge to the right.  One must either bushwack a bit to keep away from the exposure, or step out on the ledge above the arch to attain the descent.  After crossing the ledge you will find a set of bolts at the top of the second pitch of Solar Slab.  You may descend from here or continue up Solar Slab.# Location
