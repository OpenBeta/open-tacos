# Description
This route starts just to the left of where the Solar Slab route starts up from the terrace.  There is a prominent corner that curves up and to the left, forming an arch.  Climb up the slab, heading for a patch of varnish that is about twenty feet below and to the right of the bottom of the corner.  Protection is available here.  Go up and left to the corner and follow it to a bolted belay station. (5.8)Pitch 2: Continue up the corner above, passing two protection bolts, until you can tunnel up underneath the arch (5.9).  Belay on a good ledge that is halfway up the second pitch of Solar Slab.Pitch 3: Climb up and right about twenty feet to reach the bottom of a clean finger crack.  Follow this straight up (5.9) for a long pitch to the belay station at the top of Solar Slab's pitch 3.  (The upper part of this pitch has been used as a variation to Solar Slab, sometimes unintentionally.)From this point, you can continue to the top on Solar Slab, or rappel using bolted rap stations.# Location
