# Description
Start just to the left of the curving arch ofArch Enemyand climb the slab to a right-facing corner.  Excellent climbing on good rock leads to a belay ledge about 160 feet up.  Pitch 2 continues up the corner to a roof, where the rock quality declines abruptly.  Traverse right under the roof on loose rock with shaky pro.  Finish via the tunnel at the top of the arch.  A more civilized option for the second pitch would be to traverse right on varnished ledges to the belay/rap station onArch Enemy.# Location
