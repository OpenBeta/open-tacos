# Description
Although everyone comes to this wall for Solar Slab, there are other worthwhile routes nearby. One is the beautiful, but serious Sunflower. This line starts on the low-angle buttress immediately to the right of the top of the approach gully. It then follows a crack that eventually disappears while the route continues up a long stretch of blank, sweeping slab. It again gains a crack system that leads to the 2nd terrace high above.When originally climbed, the fourth pitch had only two protection bolts. Several more have since been added, making the route considerably tamer, but still somewhat runout.Pitch 1: Just to the right of the Solar Slab approach gully, climb up a very easy low-angle slab.Pitch 2: Continue up to a good ledge beneath a small, right-facing corner. There is a bolt anchor for this belay.Pitch 3: Climb straight up the right-facing corner above. Belay from 2 bolts. 5.8+, 140'Pitch 4: Head straight up off belay through delicate moves, following the bolt line. When the bolts run out, strike out through the last of the slab for the crack above. Belay when possible. 5.9, 150'Pitch 5: Continue up the crack until another belay stance appears. 5.7, 100'Pitch 6: An easy pitch leads to the base of the last pitches of Solar Slab. 5.5, 45'Descent: Descend as per Solar Slab- either rappel that route or continue to the summit of Solar Slab and descend into the Painted Bowl.# Location

Standard rack to about 3", a 4" cam may be nice to have, but not necessary.
