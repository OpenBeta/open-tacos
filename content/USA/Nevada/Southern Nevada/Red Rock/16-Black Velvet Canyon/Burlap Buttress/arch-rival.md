# Description
Arch Rival is a fairly large left facing corner/arch on the South side of the Burlap Buttress.Start in the clean cut corner and layback or jam your way up the crack.  Negotiate the entrance into a wide pod and find a balance between awkward and burly climbing as the crack becomes steeper.  Exit the wide pod and begin traversing left with the arch.  Tricky gear in unique rock with disappearing feet make this an exciting hand traverse. Follow the arch till it ends and aim for a single bolt.Pitch Extension - Not Recommended - Continue after the bolt climbing back right and then straight up a corner and around the right arete.  This upper portion has flakey rotten rock and the gear looks poor.# Location
Across of the main wash just opposite the first few routes on the Black Velvet Wall.# Protection
