# Description
Fun climbing, but still has a fair bit of loose rock.P1 (100', 5.10a): Located 40 feet right of Arrow Place, begin in a left-facing corner and climb up passing two bolts (a very loose flake lies between them - belayer beware). Instead of stepping right into the attractive arching undercling flake of Millepede, continue up the corner to a steep crux and then belaying on a slab on the right.P2 (100', 5.11b): Clip a bolt off the belay and stand up onto a big loose flake. Plug in your smallest cam and perform a difficult move to better holds. Pumpy liebacks lead to a nice varnished face and a pair of bolts. Climb up this to an anchor (somewhat hidden off to the left).Two raps to the ground.# Location
