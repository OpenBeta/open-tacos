# Description
Approximately 100' to the right of Arrow Place is a prominent undulating crack system. The middle of the first pitch is interesting and entertaining. However the start and finish of the first pitch involves deceptively awkward climbing and tenuous, hard-to-get gear. The offwidth bomb-bay chimney at the top of pitch one is short but intimidating.  And gear can only really be gotten very deep in the crack.  The belay at the top of P.1 is a manky collection of aging detritus.  It is more of a history display than a substantial anchor.  All in all this route is worth doing at least once.# Location

I found much of the pro to be difficult and tenuous.
