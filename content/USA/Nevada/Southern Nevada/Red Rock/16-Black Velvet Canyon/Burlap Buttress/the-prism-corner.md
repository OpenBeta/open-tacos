# Description
This is a surprisingly nice little corner climb that protects well and gets afternoon shade.  It would be a good choice for a budding 5.9 trad leader as the crux comes higher up and you'll have several pieces of gear below you.Descent:One single-rope rappel from slings on the bushes above and right# Location
This climb lies just right of Arch Rival as listed in the Handren Guide.# Protection
A double rack of cams from green alien to .75 camalot and singles of #1& #2 camalot
