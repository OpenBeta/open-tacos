# Description
Really fun route with good belay ledges, mostly good rock, and some memorable moments.Pitch 1 - 5.8+ (150') Head up and slightly to the right passing eight bolts, a rappel anchor on the left, and a ninth bolt that's great as a directional before making a right and easily traversing to a gear anchor at the base of a crack. Instead of making the traverse right, you can belay at the aforementioned rappel anchor and start the second pitch by continuing up and right past three bolts and joining the 2nd pitch crack before a roof.Pitch 2 - 5.10b (150') Straight up the fun crack on mostly good rock past three bolts and two minor roofs. Great climbing with a few interesting sections. Sustained at a 9+/10- grade with a short 10b crux. Pitch finishes on a good ledge with two bolts.Pitch 3 - 5.7 (80') Diagonal up and left into a chimney then up to another good ledge at the base of a left facing corner. Gear anchor.Pitch 4 - 5.9 (110') Up the corner for some fun stemming and jamming until a point where it seems natural to wander left on to the face at a thin crack. You could continue up the comfortable and progressively easier crack on the right, but NO! The face and thin crack offers good protection and really fun 5.9 face climbing that will leave you with a smile. You'll top out on a good ledge with the obvious rappel anchor.# Location
Begin just left of the big arch and to the right of Corn Flake and Poultronicus. From the ground you'll be able to locate quite a few bolts on the first pitch.# Protection
Full rack for second pitch including cams from metolius #0 up to a #3 C4. Nuts. I did not take doubles, but an extra .75 to #3 could get placed on the second pitch.
