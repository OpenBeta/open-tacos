# Description
As you reach the base of the buttress, bear slightly right.  this route faces northeast and follows a prominent, steep, left-facing dihedral for the first pitch.  The start is immediately above a yucca.  P1 goes up the thin crack for 80 or 90 feet to a bolted station.  For P2, step back into the crack and follow it straight up for another 80 or 90 feet, to another bolted station.  You can rappel from this point with a single 60-meter rope.  There are additional pitches possible, but the rock quality declines.# Location
# Protection
At the start of this route, you can make good use of Lowe Balls or very tiny cams.  The jam crack on the second pitch can use 3 or 4 #2 Camalots.
