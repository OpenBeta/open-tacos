# Description
This is a great little pitch. Located 40 feet right of Arrow Place, begin in a left-facing corner and climb up passing two bolts (a very loose flake lies between them - belayer beware). Continue up the corner until it is possible to step right into an attractive arching undercling flake. The slab under this flake has good footholds and the flake itself accepts finger-sized gear. At it's end, step up to an anchor.# Location
