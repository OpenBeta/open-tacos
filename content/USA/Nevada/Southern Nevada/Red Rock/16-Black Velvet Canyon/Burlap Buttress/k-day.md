# Description
It's a punk music reference that I don't quite understand. This is a fantastic and tough pitch. Climb an enjoyable face to a high bolt (#2 & #1 Camalots protect against a ground fall) and then trend right to the hanging tips lieback above. Three more bolts protect this with the crux coming at the bitter end. Good luck!# Location
# Protection
A total of 6 bolts. A #2 and #1 Camalot. Optional 0.5 or 0.75 Camalot to protect getting from bolt #1 to bolt #2. A 60m rope is fine for getting down.
