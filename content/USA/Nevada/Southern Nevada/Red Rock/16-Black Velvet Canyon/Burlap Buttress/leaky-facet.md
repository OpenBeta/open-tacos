# Description
Just left of the Prism Corner is another fun finger crack. Must have been done before, but is still quite flaky inside the crack in some spots, take care with gear placements. This crack is entirely hidden from the belay ledge, start up around the scrub oak and you'll find it soon enough.# Location
About 5 feet left of Prism Corner is a hidden finger crack that is invisible until youre in it. Start as for the corner, traversing up around the left side of the big scrub oak - when you see the crack up the left face, climb it.# Protection
blue metolius is the key size here, but bring up to yellow BD. shares rappel with Prism Corner (we replaced 2/20/2021)
