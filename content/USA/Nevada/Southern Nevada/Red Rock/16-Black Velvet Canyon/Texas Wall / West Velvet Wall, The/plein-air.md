# Description
Pitch 1:  Climb 5.7 chimney for 90 feet, passing 2 pro bolts, to a 2-bolt rap/belay station on a ledge.  Walk west along this ledge, tunneling under the big chockstone.  In about 200 feet there is a chimney/gully with a varnished face above it.  Belay here.Pitch 2:  Climb the chimney/gully to a 2-bolt rap/belay station on the face to the right (5.7, 80 feet).  This station is a recommended rap station, but is an optional belay station, since it can be bypassed and this pitch can be combined with the next pitch, if desired.Pitch 3:  Step right and climb delicate ramp to a pro bolt.  Now go up to left-facing corner system which leads to a large ledge with a 2-bolt rap/belay station (5.9, 100 feet)Pitch 4:  Step right and climb crack to base of big chimney where there is a 2-bolt belay station which can be bypassed on the rappels. (5.7, 60 feet)Pitch 5:  Climb offwidth crack (5.10d) through big roof at the base of the chimney.  A sequence of one or two #3 Camalots, one #4, one #5, and one #6 provide good pro until over the roof.  The crack continues to be wide (5.10a) up to the 2-bolt hanging belay/rap station, so another #3, #4, and #5 may be useful.  (120 feet, 5.10d)Pitch 6:  Surmount small, exposed roof with jam crack, then go straight up via slick face and small cracks to a small comfortable ledge with a 3-bolt belay/rap station.  There are 3 pro bolts on the upper portion of this pitch.  (160 feet, 5.10a/b, sustained)Pitch 7:  Go straight up from belay, following a crack in the exposed arÃªte, which leads into a right-facing, right-slanting V-shaped crux corner with ultra-slick black varnish on its right-hand side.  Tiny pro is possible here.  A delicate traverse leads to the right side of the white overhang, after which a stance with a 2-bolt belay/rap station is reached.  (140 feet, 5.10d/5.11a)Pitch 8:  Go straight up double cracks which are steep, varnished, and incipient.  Step right and follow parallel thin cracks to a roof, above which easier climbing leads up and left to a large ledge with a 2-bolt rap/belay station. (130 feet, 5.9)# Location
