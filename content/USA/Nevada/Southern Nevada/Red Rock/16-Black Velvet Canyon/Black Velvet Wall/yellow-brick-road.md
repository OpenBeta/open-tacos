# Description
Yellow Brick Road is more of a 2 pitch variation to Dream of Wild Turkerys.  Start by climbing the first 2 pitches of DOWT. Pitch 1- 5.6, Pitch 2- 5.8.  On pitch 3 you will start the pitch the same as you would for DOWT.  About 30ft into the pitch you will reach the rightward traverse for DOWT, instead of traversing, continue straight up the crack(at first) then follow the obvious line of bolts to a hanging belay- 5.10b. Historical note- there is a metal plaque bolted to the wall where these 2 routes diverge, it tells you which way to go! Pitch 4 follows another line of bolts above the belay. Continue up until reaching a small ledge, the belay here is shared with DOWT- 5.10a.  Pitch 5 follow the left-facing flake to its top, passing several bolts, then traverse back left(bolts) to gain a crack.  Follow this crack up approx 20 ft to a "scooped" ledge on the left.  From here you can either continue up DOWT or rappel using anchors on DOWT, and the Gobbler.  Bring 2 ropes if you choose to rap.# Location

A standard rack to a #1 camalot will suffice.
