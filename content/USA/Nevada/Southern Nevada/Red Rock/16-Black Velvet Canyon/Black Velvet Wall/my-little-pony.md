# Description
This phenomenal route has fallen into obscurity - perhaps due to lack of information - but it should not be missed by those interested in something more unusual and difficult than the standard Black Velvet fare.P1-3: Climb the first 3 pitches of Sour Mash, but instead of belaying on the comfy ledge below pitch 4, move right to an equally spacious ledge with a single cold shut bolt.  This ledge is a little ways below the standard belay ledge.P4: Notice the two attractive, left-facing corners far above you.  Velveeta takes the right hand corner and My Little Pony takes the left hand.  Climb up and right with reasonable, but spaced, protection for a long pitch to a good belay ledge below the corner.P5: Climb the beautiful varnished corner, passing a single bolt (crux - a wonderful stemming sequence) to an uncomfortable belay on the right hand wall.  I can't remember exactly what this belay consisted of but I remember it being less than ideal.  5.11d, 80'.P6: Continue up the corner (which eventually changes aspects) until reaching a roof and very steep rock - pull through this to an exposed stretch of climbing and a belay at two bolts on a narrow ledge.  This pitch has some junky rock but is outrageously good.  5.11, 100'.P7: Finish by climbing up a long crack with ample face holds to a terrace above and to the left of the Black Tower.  Traverse to and rappel down Epi with two ropes.# Location
# Protection
A single set of cams from blue Alien to #3 Camalot, wires (include a few offsets and larger RP's).  Two ropes for a safe descent.  It is possible to rap down the route with a single 70m rope, but you'll need quicklinks for the bolted anchor and extra tat for the anchor above the crux pitch.
