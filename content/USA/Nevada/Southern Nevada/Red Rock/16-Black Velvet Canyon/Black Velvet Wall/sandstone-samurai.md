# Description
Sandstone Samurai is a route that has a bit of a reputation amongst Red Rocks climbers as being a psychological test piece: The story I heard is that the Adventure Punks established Rock Warrior as a response to the heavy-handed bolting by certain beloved Red Rocks first ascensionists, and then a year later PVB decided to up the ante by putting up something that was even bolder.He succeeded - Sandstone Samurai is indeed a big step up from Rock Warrior - a route that  shouldn't be taken lightly! If you decide to climb it, be prepared for R-rated climbing on every pitch (run outs with falls that would likely result in injury) and possible X-rated climbing in a couple spots (if you fell, you'd almost certainly be maimed or worse); onsighting would probably be a good idea. But the climbing is fun and at the very least more engaging than it's better-protected neighbor two climbs to the right.Anyway, the descriptions in the current guidebooks are adequate to keep you from getting lost so in an effort to preserve a sense of adventure for the full Sandstone Samurai experience, I'll leave it at that.Have fun and good luck!# Location
