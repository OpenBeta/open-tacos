# Description
If you ever find yourself at the base of Black Velvet Wall with enough gear this can be a fun end of the day climb. This is a nice fun finger crack with the start being the most challenging and getting easier as it goes. Be careful at the top of the route as their may be some questionable rock. I think that this route would clean up if traveled on a bit more. The crux may be having  the right gear considering most people who go to the Black Velvet wall come only with a light rack.# Location
Walk uphill to the far left of the Black Velvet wall to about 15 yards shy of the gully that divides Whiskey Peak and the Black Velvet Wall. Look for a finger crack that turns into a right facing dihedral for the first 30 feet.# Protection
Single rack 2" and doubles/triples in the finger size range. Nice new anchors with raps rings at the top. Be careful when lowering/rappelling with a 60m, tie knots in the end to be safe.
