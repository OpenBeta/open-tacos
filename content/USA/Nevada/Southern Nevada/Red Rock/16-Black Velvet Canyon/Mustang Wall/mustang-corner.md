# Description
This is the obvious direct version of the third pitch of Mustang Cracks. Instead of avoiding the corner - commit to it. Historically and easily top roped, Mustang Corner protects nicely with many small stoppers and RP's - although the pro isn't always perfect and stances for placing it can be tenuous, with patience a leader should be able to get something reliable in every body-length or two. The movement is absolutely classic - you'll be stoked to do this pitch!# Location
# Protection
1 set of cams from tiny to 0.75 Camalot.1 set of stoppers.2-3x sets RP's. I didn't find offsets useful at all but I did enjoy having a variety of different types of pro (authentic RP's, BD Micro Stoppers, and Metolius Astro Nuts).
