# Description
We were lured back there by Handren's "finest finger crack" comment.. Unfortunately, (hindsight being a bitch) we only brought finger sized gear!  The first half is a 5 inch corner crack and the roof really calls for another big piece.  We bailed halfway up on a yellow metolius.# Location
My boy fixed all new lines for the approach...  Enjoy the lines!  One involved naked swimming through the devil's anus to get it fixed... (you'll see) LOL# Protection
Two 5's wouldn't go unused.  Big question mark concerning gear linking the roof section to the crack proper
