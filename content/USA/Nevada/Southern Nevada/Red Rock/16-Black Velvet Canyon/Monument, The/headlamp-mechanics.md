# Description
Find the twin cracks. Step Into the Squeezer starts in the hand crack on the left (5.8), then merges into the chimney on the right(5.9). Headlamp Mechanics finishes up a stellar finger crack up and left.Climb the hand crack, and when it merges into the chimney, place a #5 cam high, sling it long, and step left (flat foot sized pedestal feature). Â  Small cams protect the bottom of the crack and a single steep move.After that it's pure fun to the anchor.About the same difficulty and quality as Topless Twins.# Location
Same as Step into the Squeezer and Chinese Handcuffs.The double cracks to a chimney is a dead giveaway.# Protection
.1-5. Doubles .3-1. (No #4 needed)
