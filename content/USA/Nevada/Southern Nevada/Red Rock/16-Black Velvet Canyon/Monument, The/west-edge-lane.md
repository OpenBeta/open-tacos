# Description
West Edge Lane takes the sharp arête directly below Desert Gold.  It begins up Clipper (the dihedral to the right) and then moves left and flirts with the arête past 5 bolts to a chain anchor on a small ledge just below the first belay of Desert Gold.The crux is at the very top, but several difficult sections, often using fragile, small flakes, make this a challenging route.  This route will become much more difficult/impossible if these holds break, so wear your kid gloves.# Location
# Protection
Five bolts and an anchor.
