# Description
This stemming and smearing testpiece is a real gem.Scramble up the bottom of Lizard Locks. Where the finger crack starts, step right around the corner (not easy) and prepare to face the insecurity. Â Stem, layback, smear, and swear your way to the top.Luckily this is easily top roped off the LL anchor, because I won't be leading this until I get a terminal diagnosis.# Location
Same start as Lizard Locks, but on the right side of the feature.# Protection
I dunno. Small, tiny, and little.
