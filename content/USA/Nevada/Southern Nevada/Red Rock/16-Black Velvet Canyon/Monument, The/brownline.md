# Description
A fun and varied splitter crack leads to a choose-your-own-adventure varnished face with lots of shade.P1: Negotiate about 5' of choss and climb onto the block at the start of the crack and put in some gear up high. A crux comes early with a section of thin hands leading to a section of ring locks before a foot ledge offers some respite. Climb through a section of fingers that pinches off to a thin section before a great hand crack. Just when you thought you were having fun, the hand crack gets wide and goes to a section of belly crawling around a roof to a huge ledge and a good two bolt belay.P2: Put a draw on one of the anchor bolts and step around the corner to an exposed face to begin your journey upward. Pretty much everything on this face is a hold. The easiest way up this is probably well protected 5.6, and the hardest could leave you doing some 5.10 moves with tiny gear below. The varnish provides a combination of pure jug joy and some nerve-wracking exposure. Press on to a two bolt anchor at the top of the formation.Two raps with a 70m rope will take you to the ground.# Location
Access the route by scrambling the gully to the right of Desert Gold. The crack is visible on the left wall and has a decent belay stance at the base.# Protection
Double rack to #2, a #3 and #4 can be of use on P1. 70M Rope.
