# Description
Chinese Handcuffs is the obvious sick looking tips & ringlock splitter on quality looking sandstone on the northern end of The Monument wall.Begin up the twin cracks moving from one crack to another. Very good and varied movement. Surmount a bulge midway and stare up at the vicious splitter that awaits. Plug some gear and chug-a-lug your way up clipping the bolt if you please or placing a small cam that protects the strenuous crux quite nicely. Continue upwards. Nice send, friend.Rap off the pine tree at the top.# Location
# Protection
Double cams from .3-.75 (Camalots) 1 each #1 & #2. C3's or TCU's at the very top.
