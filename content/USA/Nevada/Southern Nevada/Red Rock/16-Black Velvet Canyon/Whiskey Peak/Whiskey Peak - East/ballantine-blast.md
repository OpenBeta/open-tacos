# Description
Just to the right of the S-shaped crack of Lazy Buttress, there is a ramp leading up and to the right.Pitch 1: Easy climbing leads up the ramp, past an unnecessary belay station to a left-facing dihedral.  Climb the dihedral, passing another unnecessary bolt, and belay at its top.Pitch 2: Climb up about fifteen feet to  a slightly bulging headwall.  A 5.7 move over the overhang leads to beautiful and easy face climbing.  The knobby face leads upward to two overhangs.  The easiest route passes the lower overhang on the left and continues up the slab to a good belay ledge.  This pitch is almost 60 meters in length.  (The higher overhang has harder climbing and less protection.)Pitch 3: Either go straight up on easy climbing to Lovers' Ledge, or bear to the left and join the Lazy Buttress where it goes over the 5.6 overhang.# Location
