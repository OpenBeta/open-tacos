# Description
Another Whisky Peak cragging route. It's definitely worth it if you're looking for something new in the area or if it's crowded.P1 - The gnarled and kind of scary roof. Climb up 10 ft. and get in a nest of not-so-great pro. Make a committing move to gain the undercling crack in the roof, get in some good gear, and continue up better rock to an anchor. 60 ft. 5.10dP2 - Head up the beautiful, varnished, slot of a corner with a tips crack in the back. There are plenty of pods for your fingers and bigger pro. Pull a small roof and carry on over the bigger roof on jugs. It would have been nice to stop here, but continue up easier climbing to the anchor. 150 ft. 5.10c# Location
Corner system one left of The Misunderstanding which is left of Triassic Sands, Ixtlan, etc. Start under the big, ugly roof.# Protection
Single rack with some extra small (esp. grey and purple metolius) to finger size is nice. Two 70s made it all the way to the ground. Two 60s might, but if not stop at the first anchor.Bottom anchor is nuts and tat. Take some new webbing, at the very least, for the top anchor which consists of a nut, jammed not, and slung rock feature.
