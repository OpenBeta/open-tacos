# Description
This is an excellent little pitch that has surely been top-roped from the Closed on Monday anchors, if not led, in the past. Together, the pair of routes is very worthwhile and would be a great warmup for Only the Good Die Young.Begin below a roof under the pretty, varnished, left-facing corner. Burly moves through the roof and getting established into the corner are the crux - once through it, have your belayer reach up and unclip any gear you placed here to prevent drag. Continue via enjoyable corner climbing and spaced, but excellent, gear.This route could really use a proper bolted anchor to spare the current tree anchor.# Location
A short scramble up the gully from Only the Good Die Young. Begin below a pretty, varnished, left-facing corner.# Protection
1x small to #2 Camalot.
