# Description
About thirty feet left of Frogland is a small, right-facing corner.  Another fifteen feet left is a larger, left-facing corner.  Start here and climb up to the left end of the big ledge marking the first belay on Frogland.  The second pitch is the same as pitch 2 of Bourbon Street.  Pitch 3 goes straight up to the beginning of the good varnished rock, then moves right on easy ledges.  Pitch 4 starts with a zigzag to the right, then back into an obvious chimney.  Pitch 5 goes up and right on deteriorating rock, ultimately reaching broken third-class rock just west of the Whiskey Peak summit.Other than possibly as a variation on pitch 1 of Frogland, there is not much reason to do this route.  It was stumbled upon via a routefinding error while attempting Bourbon Street, which is a far better route.# Location
