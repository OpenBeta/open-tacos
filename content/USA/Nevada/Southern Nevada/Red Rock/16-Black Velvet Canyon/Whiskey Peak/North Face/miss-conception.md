# Description
This climb starts up a left-facing corner to a bulge and onto a small ledge to the left side of a roof. Pass this while moving right and around the roof, up to a fixed anchor.I do not remember the second pitch well, but Swain states that you need draws for the 'many bolts' to continue up the second pitch on the right... I don't recall how many myself.Rap on two 60 meter ropes from the second fixed anchor to the ground.Pitch 3 follows 10 bolts to a two-bolt anchor at about 90â€™ Progressively more difficult moves and progressively better stone leads to a thin crux at the last two bolts. 10d/11a seems to be the consensus on this pitch. Rivals anything on Black Velvet proper.# Location
This is the next left-facing corner to the left of the area classics Mazatlan and Ixtalan, and is just to the right of the route Misunderstanding.# Protection
A standard Rack + draws.
