# Description
One of my favorite short trad climbs of all time!  Two excellent pitches are different in character but both technical and delicate.  Not nearly as scary as the guide makes it out to be.  Start on the front of the Our Father/Wholesome Fullback pinnacle at a thin crack and face.P1: Climb straight up past a few bolts to a mantle ledge, clip the bolt above from this ledge, shake out, then reverse the mantle and finger traverse right for a ways until a weakness allows you to pull the roof and climb back left (an RP is useful to protect this "scary" section).  Belay in a little hole with a nest of decent gear.  5.11a.P2: Climb out right to the exposed, sharp, arete and up this past several bolts.  Pull onto the face and continue up easier (possibly loose) rock until a final mantle lands you at the top of the pillar.  5.11a.Rap Our Father.# Location
