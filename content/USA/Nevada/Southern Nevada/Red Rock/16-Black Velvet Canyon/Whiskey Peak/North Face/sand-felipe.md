# Description
Probably a three-star pitch before it was retrobolted into submission.  Begin just left of Triassic Sands and follow the obvious line of shiny bolts to a two-bolt anchor.If you don't have enough draws, don't worry; in many places you can simple reach down, unclip the draw at your feet, and clip it into the next bolt.  Nevertheless, the pitch does offer outstanding face climbing.A single rap with a 70m cord will get you down, or you can continue past a few more bolts up a very short second pitch (that appeared to be of lesser quality from below).# Location

A dozen or so draws.
