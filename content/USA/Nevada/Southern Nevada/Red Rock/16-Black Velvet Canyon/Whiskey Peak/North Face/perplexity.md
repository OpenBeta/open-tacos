# Description
Perplexity takes the black face past three bolts to a long, leaning obtuse corner just left of The Misunderstanding.Climb up to the first bolt (welded coldshut) and perform a few cruxy moves up past the second bolt to a ledge and rest stance.  Clip a third bolt (Swain homemade hanger), and traverse left and up easy rock to the base of the corner.  Ascend this corner via thin locks and good face holds on the left wall.  Bring your 00 TCUs and don't expect any fixed pins.  Two single-rope raps down The Misunderstanding.# Location
# Protection
SR plus 2x 00 TCUs or equivalent gear.  Brass can help too.
