Those uncomfortable with #6 cracks may opt to bring one for a 12’ section of splitter 6’s. A low angle layback leads to a ledge. Step right and face climb up poorly protected moves to the obvious hand crack roof. The very strenuous roof puts you on a big ledge system. Alternatively exit left through the notch, avoiding the roof and keeping the grade at 5.9.Descent: Head down and skiers right. The top of “Only the Good Die Young” is at the edge of the wall. Continue down this descent by switchbacking left across a steep slab. A short down scramble leads to a rap tree. A single 80’ rappel puts you back on the approach.# Location
