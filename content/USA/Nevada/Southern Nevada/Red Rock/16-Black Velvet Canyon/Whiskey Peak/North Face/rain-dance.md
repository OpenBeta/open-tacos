# Description
This is a great and overlooked route that completely avoids frogland and If you are a ten leader you have to lead it sometime...Start in the center of the f.land buttress and follow the flake all the way to the top. The pro is much better than it would appear. The book calls for a single rack to one inch but we found a place for a .75, 1, and 2 camalot sizes as well.# Location
