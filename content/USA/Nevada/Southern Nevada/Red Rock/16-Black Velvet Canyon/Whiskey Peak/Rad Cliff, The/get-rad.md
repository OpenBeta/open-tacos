# Description
Get Rad follows the awesome right-leaning splitter wide crack atThe Rad Cliff.  Inside the crack you will discover quality clean cut stone with very few features. Squeeze climb for about 75' before the crack forces you to exit onto slightly easier terrain.  Then continue up the great hand crack/flare ofThe Chamber of Secretsto finish.  This is an adventurous crack climb with a little something for everyone.# Location
