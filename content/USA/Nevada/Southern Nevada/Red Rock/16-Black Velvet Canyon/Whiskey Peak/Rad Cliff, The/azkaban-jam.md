# Description
At the eastern end ofThe Rad Cliffis a dark buttress with a prominent crack on its right side.  Climb straight up the crack.  Be careful passing a loose block about 30 feet up.  When the difficulties ease, continue a short distance to a belay alcove where a narrow knobby catwalk leads to the right across a varnished face.  The easiest exit is a 4th class traverse about 60 feet to the right to a rappel tree at the top ofThe Dementor.  A two-rope rappel leads back to the base.An alternative exit is to continue up easy rock for a half pitch to the top of the buttress, then scramble down to the east.# Location
