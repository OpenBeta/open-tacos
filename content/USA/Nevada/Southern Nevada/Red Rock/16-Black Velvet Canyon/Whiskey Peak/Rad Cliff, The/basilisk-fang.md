# Description
Pretty good climbing starting on the left side of the formation, then trending up and right. There are some fragile edges and fins that will wear away with a few more ascents. The rock is generally sound and the climbing enjoyable.# Location
# Protection
A standard rack to 3" should do. It takes wires and cams and the pro is good.
