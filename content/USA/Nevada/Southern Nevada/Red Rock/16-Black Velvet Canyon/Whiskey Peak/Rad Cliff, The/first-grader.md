# Description
Immediately to the right of Back to Basics is a slanting finger crack.  Follow it until it ends,then wander up and right to another crack, which leads to the belay bolts.  Don't be fooled by the mild rating and innocuous name.  This is not really a beginners' route.  The protection is limited and you have to work a bit to get it.  A single 60-meter rope is enough for the rappel.# Location
# Protection
some thin cams and wires are needed
