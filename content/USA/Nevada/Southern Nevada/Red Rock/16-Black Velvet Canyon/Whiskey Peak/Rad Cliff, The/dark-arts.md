# Description
Thirty feet to the right of the Cadillac Crack is a 15-foot pedestal of white rock leaning against the darkly varnished face.  Climb up and left from the top of the pedestal to a narrow catwalk ledge.  Move left along the ledge until it is possible to climb up to a small left-facing dihedral.  Follow this upward until it joins Cadillac Crack in the alcove below the final chimney and hand crack.# Location
