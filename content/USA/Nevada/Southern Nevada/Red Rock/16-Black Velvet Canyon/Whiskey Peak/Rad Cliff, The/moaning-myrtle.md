# Description
Twenty feet to the right ofAzkaban Jam, and immediately to the right of the arete ofRita Skeeteris a deceptive dihedral with a few jammed blocks. Easy climbing leads up to an impasse. The exit move left requires a verrrry long stretch. If you are less than 6'4", this move is much harder than 5.9. On the first ascent, this section was protected by blindly lassoing a horn. Climb into the wide crack above and follow it to a big ledge.# Location
