# Description
About 60 or 80 feet to the right ofAzkaban Jamis an ominous triangular cave.  This route climbs all the way into the back of the cave, then chimneys out to the lip.Pitch 1: a short 4th class pitch leads to a belay spot just below the cave.Pitch 2: jam the crack on the right, all the way into the back of the cave.  Chimney down and out toward the lip.  One or two hand-size cams can be placed near the lip.  Jam out and set up a hanging belay just outside (to minimize rope drag).  This is a bad pitch to fall from; even the second can take quite a swing and find themselves in prusik country.Pitch 3: A short pitch leads up to the big ledge.Rappel the route.# Location
