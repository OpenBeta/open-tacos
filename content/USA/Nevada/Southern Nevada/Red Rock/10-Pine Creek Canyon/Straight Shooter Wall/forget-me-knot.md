# Description
Another tough .11 face/slab route to end-cap Slabba Dabba Doo and Sidewinder. Starts in a pin/tiny RP seam just left of S.D.D., the ASCA replaced bolt is a reddish orange, helps distinguish this one from its neighbor to the right. Thin, techy climbing on the lower wall is followed by a clipped bolt and a traverse to the anchor of Straight Shooter, or continuing up Bird Crack on gear to an anchor. The climbing on the upper crack is friable and not trivial, micro wires mandatory.# Location
25 feet left of Straight Shooter# Protection
Micro wires, TCUs, a couple of mid-sized cams.
