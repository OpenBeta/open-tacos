# Description
Splitting the Straight Shooter wall is a perfect little finger crack.  This is Straight Shooter.There are no feet through the crux and if your fingers are on the large side it will feel harder than 5.9 (it did for me).  Very short but fun little climb.Rap with 1 rope.There is a 5.11a right of this route that can be TR'd after SS is led.  Thin slab!# Location
