# Description
This is a possible second pitch to Straight Shooter.  It begins by traversing 20' left from the SS anchor to a vertical seam with a bolt.The reachy start is the crux but the climb is steep and engaging throughout.  It's 60' long, with a 3 bolt anchor (2 old, 1 new).This is harder than Mushroom People and a more technical lead.  I thought the rock quality wasn't that great, but the immaculate first pitch may have clouded my judgment.  An OK climb, but there are many better ones nearby.# Location
