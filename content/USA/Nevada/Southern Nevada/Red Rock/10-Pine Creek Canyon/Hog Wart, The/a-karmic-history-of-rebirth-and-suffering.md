# Description
"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." And if you choose to climb here, you might be doomed anyhow…1) Start in a claustrophobic alcove. Climb the parallel cracks to the slot of sky; squeeze to liberation. Continue up the crack in the corner. Pull over a chockstone (rope drag happens here) and step to the back of a sandy corridor. Chimney and jam up the sandy slot; once free, up to a belay in an alcove on the right. 120’2) Follow the crack/corner up, into, and through the overhang, then past a bomb bay chimney to a spacious ledge with large blocks. 100’# Location
Starts in an alcove with parallel cracks that lead up to a slice of sky.# Protection
Normal rack, green alien to #5 camalot; extra #3 & #4 Camalots.
