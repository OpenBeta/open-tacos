# Description
Varied, wide crack climbing to, then past, the triangular roof. If you own multiple #4 and #5 camalots, this climb is for you; if you don't own these fine items, this is your excuse. The climb gets plenty of sun on a winter day. No exotic plants were harmed during our ascent, but the crew was busy along the loop road that afternoon.# Location
On climber's right side at the mouth of Stick Gulley, the obvious, straight, wide crack in a corner between Megamoto and A Cosmic History of Rebirth and Suffering.# Protection
The crack business is #4 and #5 Camalots. A nut and a thumb sized cam are useful at/through the roof. #1-3 camalots for anchor and perhaps en route inbetween the big guns. Chockstone anchor or continue up Megamoto.
