# Description
P1: Power up the steep finger crack on the right. Ride the crack to ledges. Move the belay up and right to the base of the obvious wide fist crack that narrows to hands and smaller as it bulges right. 100’P2: Up the crack; right around the bulge; “as the road gets tighter, things get better and better”; up the crack/chimney; when the chimney seems implausible, step out right and climb the black face to a spacious ledge with large blocks. 120’# Location
Starts from the spacious block top up and right of the alcove start of Karmic History.# Protection
Normal rack, green alien to #4 camalot; Perhaps extra blue & grey Camalot Jrs for P1 & extra blue and grey Camalots for P2. You could leave a #6 just off the ground on P2 for your 2nd to bring up…
