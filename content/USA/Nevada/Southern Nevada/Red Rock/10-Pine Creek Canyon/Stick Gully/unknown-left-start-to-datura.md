# Description
A pleasant start to Datura that avoids its P1 short chimney struggle and P2 bushwhack. Up the slab to the crack, up. When the bushes on top of the buttress appear, diagonal down to the huge pine tree at the start of the business on Datura.# Location
Start in the spacious Datura alcove. Head up the slab on climber's left to bushes. Descent as for Datura.# Protection
Normal rack. You'll have more than enough gear for this pitch if you've come prepared for the Datura's 3rd/4th pitches. You'll get to perfect your #3/#4 camalot technique on low angle terrain.
