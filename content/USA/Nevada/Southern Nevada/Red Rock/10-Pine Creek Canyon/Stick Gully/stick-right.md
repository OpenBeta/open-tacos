# Description
The easier version of Stick Left, this route climbs a thinner crack past a nice layback crux (huff and puff) to a funky chimney and a fun finish. Like its neighbor, this is a neglected classic with a variety of moves on it and solid gear. May feel tough for a Red Rock 5.9 sport climber, but grade is on the money. Bolted anchor.# Location
Right side of Stick Gully, 15 feet right of Stick Left. Nature is Fun (5.9+, 3-4 pitches) is directly across the gully.# Protection
Standard Rack, Two 50m ropes to rappel
