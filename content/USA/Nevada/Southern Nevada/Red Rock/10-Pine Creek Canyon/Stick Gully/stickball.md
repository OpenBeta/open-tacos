# Description
A fun and worthwhile toprope-after all, you humped the gear all the way up here, why not get some mileage? The moves felt sustained and the rock wasn't worth betting your life on, but the route has good movement and is a nice contrast to the two on the left. The reason for the name is a cool hold that is shaped like a glued-on softball.# Location
Start just right of Stick Right and follow the arete to the ball hold to the shared finish and anchors.# Protection
Gear is well spaced, mostly small. Like most Swain routes, I wouldn't reccommend this as a lead to anyone I liked. Two ropes to rappel.
