# Description
A nice wide crack.# Location
About midway between strait shooter and stick gully there is a short wall with a black varnished patch covering the top half.# Protection
We did it with a rack to 3", with one 4 and 5 cam each. This route has no fixed gear, but a bolted anchor from an unknown route to the left can be utilized for belaying/descent.
