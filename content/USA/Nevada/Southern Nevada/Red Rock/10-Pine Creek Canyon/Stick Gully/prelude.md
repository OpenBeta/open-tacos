# Description
A dusty pitch that might not be popular even if it were easy to get to and saw enough traffic to clean it up. Some might think it a reasonable warm-up & approach to Shadow Play.Somehow struggle up to a chimney alcove at the base of a handcrack. Up the handcrack, and then up the left angling weakness/crack system to the Shadow Play ledge system.# Location
below and slightly right of Shadow Play; see Shadow Play beta photo# Protection
normal rack
