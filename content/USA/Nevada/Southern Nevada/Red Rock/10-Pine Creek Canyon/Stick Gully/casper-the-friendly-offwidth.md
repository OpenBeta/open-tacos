# Description
much quality stemming, chimneying, mayhem, etc. some short, sandy bits.# Location
the obvious off width/chimney right of Shadow Play; to descend, hike down the gulley, climber's right# Protection
lots of #6 Camalot and #6 Wild Country cam territory; the latter works better in several sections. one of everything else, gray camalot jr->grey camelot; was very happy to have a #3 camelot for the exit moves. got mileage out of three offset cams in the .5/.75 camalot range. once on top, walk back 50 feet to a tree. all those #5 camelots you brought but never used can be included in an anchor closer to the lip.
