# Description
Quality chimneying.# Location
From the large pine tree at the start of the Datura business, head up the chimney on the left instead of the normal route.From the ledge at the top of the chimney, we did an easy escape pitch left to a big pine tree with rap slings. Two short raps lead back to the pine tree; scramble down to the lower rap on Datura. It may be possible to escape right to the Datura anchors.# Protection
If you have the big gear for the Datura regular route, you're probably OK here too. That said, we enjoyed bumping the larger valley giant mid-pitch. One of everything, nuts to huge cams.
