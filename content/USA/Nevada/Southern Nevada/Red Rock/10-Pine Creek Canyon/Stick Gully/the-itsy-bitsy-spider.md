# Description
A must-do roof with nice, easier climbing above and below. The rock in the roof itself is impeccable; elsewhere, some flaky and sandy rock will clean up nicely with traffic.4 x 30-meter bolted rappels to the packs.# Location
In the major, left-angling gully above the Stick Gully bouldering area, a small sandstone arch marks the base of the continuous crack system left of Promote the Segregation (and just left of the bolted crack system/face left of Promote the Segregation).# Protection
Normal rack to 4 inches. 4-6 inch & finger-sized cams for P1 belay. 5" cam for the roof.
