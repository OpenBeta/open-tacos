# Description
Quality, steep #3 camalot crack climbing with a pair of bonus, wide sections.Face climb around the bush that guards the start; chimney/stem to the #6 sized crack; struggle to the hand jams; jam; struggle...As you pull the final move out of the crack, look left and marvel at the piton placed under the foot-stool sized block on the ledge you're belly flopping onto...# Location
at the mouth of stick gulley, a short way up-gulley from the bouldering boulders; just left of the all too obvious, right leaning chimney (Abstinence). rappel from the thorny shrub of your choice or long 3rd/4th class scramble (a long way) left to the start of unknown 5.8# Protection
one of everything, .4=>6 camalots, many #3 camalots (4 could easily be used); maybe another #4
