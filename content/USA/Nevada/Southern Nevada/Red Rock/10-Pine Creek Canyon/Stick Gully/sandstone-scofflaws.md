# Description
An alternate start to The Itsy Bitsy Spider. Higher quality rock would make this a fun pitch, but until a bunch of folks climb this while it’s wet (please, be our guest to do so…), this piece of stone is best to avoided.Climb cracks and corners past ledges. Eventually trend right to join The Itsy Bitsy Spider below its roof pitch. From here, either continue on The Itsy Bitsy Spider, or downlead ~50’ climber’s right (5.7) to a bolted anchor on a ledge just past a tree.# Location
Start at the base of a left-facing corner/crack system ~ 50 feet left of The Itsy Bitsy Spider.# Protection
