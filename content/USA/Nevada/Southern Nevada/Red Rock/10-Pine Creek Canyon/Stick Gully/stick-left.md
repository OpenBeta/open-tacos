# Description
Stick Left is classic Red Rock at its best. Situated  on beautiful chocolate varnished rock, this route has everything-perfect hands to start, cups leading to fists to a memorable lieback crux, to sustained and interesting climbing above. Pro is excellent the whole way, the only possible down side to this route is the rope eating pull from the bolted anchor. Worth the hike and then some.# Location
Upon entering the Stick gully, there is an obvious huge roof on the left, about 3/4 of the way up. Across from this is an attractive steep fist crack going through a bulge. About ten minutes hike up the gully you will find the routes; try to follow cairns and be respectful of the recently burned flora and very crispy soil.# Protection
Double up on cams, 3 #3 camalot or equiv, a couple of bigger pieces for the faint of heart.
