# Description
This isn't Really an independent route so much as a variation to Stick left.Climb the crack that zigzags, at first, then straights out. This leads to a solid flake/block in the crack. Crank past the block and continue following the crack until it joins stick left at the top of its crux (lip of the roof). Follow Stick left to its bolted anchor. Note: not easy to TR from the Stick left anchor due to a possible swing, use directionals if you want to TR it.# Location
The very obvious crack just left of Stick Left.# Protection
A set of nuts and Double cams from Yellow Alien through #3 camalot. 1 #4 camalot for the top.
