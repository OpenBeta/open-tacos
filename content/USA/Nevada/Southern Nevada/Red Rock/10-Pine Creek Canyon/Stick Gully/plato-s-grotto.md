# Description
Rather civilized as wide cracks go. Varied techniques may be employed. The consternating bolt at the top of the formation is not ours; with long slings/the rest of the rope, a trad anchor can be had.# Location
The obvious corner/chimney just left of Shadow Play# Protection
lots of cams fingers to #6 camalot; if you don't have multiple big #5&6pieces, consider belaying at the ledge system 30 feet up (belay takes multiple #3&4 camalots...)
