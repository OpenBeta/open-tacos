# Description
low angle climbing on featured, black flakes. good fun; lots of sun. Many flakes are fragile--not recommended for the budding 5.5 leader.# Location
the left side of the black face, climber's right on the approach gulley to Shadow Play and Promote the Segregation; start about 120 feet up the gulley, where it widens, where a 2nd horizontal crack/weakness intersects the gulley. go up, roughly following a crack/weakness to the belay ledge. walk off climber's left and back down the gulley to the base.# Protection
standard rack; anchor building at the top is fiddly.
