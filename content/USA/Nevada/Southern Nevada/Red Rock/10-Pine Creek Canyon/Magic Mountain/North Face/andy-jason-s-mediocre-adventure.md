# Description
If you ever find yourself wandering from the vicinity of Dog Police to Community Pillar, Honeycomb Chimney, Small Purchase, etc. then you might see this line. If that's the case you could potentially climb this line.To the left of Community Pillar is a amphitheater like feature with a splitter handcrack next to a corner covered in bushes. This is Andy & Jason's Mediocre Adventure.Scramble up dirty ledges to reach the varnished crack. Use the adjacent corner on the right to get into the crack. About 20 feet up you'll be forced to commit to the left crack. Lieback & jam your way up this to the top where a slopey and lichen encrusted chimney awaits. Up this and anchor at a tree.A sling and locker remain for the rappel after the coveted 2nd Ascent of this beauty.# Location
