# Description
This is a fine pitch that doesn't see much traffic - but it should. It's a bit dirty, and the cruxes are brief, but the climbing is fun from top to bottom.Begin in the juggy corner just left of Bro's. Climb this corner to a ledge, clip a Z-pin (or not... other, better gear exists nearby) and execute a cruxy reach and mantle. Continue mantling up ledges (run out) to regain the corner which is followed to a bolt. One more move here leads to more jugs up the steep corner and an anchor on the right.# Location
