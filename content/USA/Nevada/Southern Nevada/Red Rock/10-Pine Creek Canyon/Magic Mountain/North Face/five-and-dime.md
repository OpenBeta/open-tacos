# Description
Five and Dime is located on the same pillar as Small Purchase which is on the east side of the next gully west of Cartwright Corner. This gully is a rap route for Community Pillar and it provides the left margin of Magic Triangle.The route climbs the razor-edge arÃªte just 15 feet left of Small Purchase. There are four awkwardly placed bolts leading to a roof. The climbing here is technical and balance oriented. Once at the roof, go left to a finger crack and head up to the top, past one more bolt. Use the same 3-bolt anchor as Small Purchase to rappel 100 feet.# Location
