# Description
Saucerful of Secretsfeatures a hidden beautiful overhanging arete pitch that is worth the effort required to get to it.  This route is likely shaded much of the time and is likely relatively well-protected from the wind.The first 2 pitches are shared withCartwright Corner.  Climb cracks on the general right side of the large bush-filled chimney right ofCommunity Pillar- it's not as bad as it appears (2 pitches, 5.8, 100', and 5.9, 120').  The obvious overhanging prow looms above.  A 50' pitch 3 (5.7) up blocks gets you to the base of the arete.The crux prow pitch is hard 5.11 with no rests for the better part of 150'.  Clip a bolt just above the belay, then climb a thin crack to a hand crack, then step left of the prow.  Make wild moves, switching sides of the bolted overhanging arete to a bolted anchor.  A short but fun 50' all-bolted 5.10c pitch up an off-balance flared corner reaches the top.Rap the route with 2 ropes.# Location
