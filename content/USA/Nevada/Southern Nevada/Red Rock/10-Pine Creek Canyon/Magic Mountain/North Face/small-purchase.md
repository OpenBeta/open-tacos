# Description
This neat little route is one of the few Joe Herbst routes you'll find that can be classified as a finger crack. It can be found on the south side of Pine Creek Canyon (the shady side!), about 100 yards to the right of Community Pillar and about 100' left of the start of Magic Triangle.The route ascends a right facing dihedral that steadily gets steeper as it gets higher. Just left of the route is the bolted arete ofFive and Dime.Start climbing at the base of the corner, under some ledges. Work your way up and ascend the corner. Be careful of the loose block near the top.A single rope rappel gets you back down.# Location
# Protection
Bring a fair assortment of stoppers and doubles of smallish stuff to a #.75 camalot. Single cams to 3" is good, a 4" wont hurt you, but is not required.
