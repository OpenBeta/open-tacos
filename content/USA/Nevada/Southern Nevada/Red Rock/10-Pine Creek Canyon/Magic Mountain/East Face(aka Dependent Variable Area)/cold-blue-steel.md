# Description
This route is dangerous and should not be attempted by the faint of heart.You have to make a move that would be extremely difficult to reverse before you get the first piece in. yikes :( Getting to the first bolt I lost my nerve and lowered off. (booty) Good Luck.# Location
Far left side of the Magic Mountain area in Pine Creek. Page 171 in the new Jerry Handren Red Rock Guide.# Protection
There is no protection and the rock is breakable for the first 30 feet.
