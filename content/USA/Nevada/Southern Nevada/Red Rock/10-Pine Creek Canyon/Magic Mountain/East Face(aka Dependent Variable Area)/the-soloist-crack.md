# Description
I bought a Soloist from Wren Industries around 1985 and after a few practice routes, I went up to this crack and climbed it.# Location
The route is about 200 yards or so left of Dog Police.# Protection
The route takes mostly finger and hand sized pro. The belay is a fixed nut and a quarter inch button head with an RP keyhole hanger :(
