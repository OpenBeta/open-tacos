# Description
Awesome-looking line up the middle of the best-looking black buttress right of Flight Path. Starts with an overhung pink rock roof (may need a partner boost!). Unfortunately, the giant hollow flake that you have to use, loose rock crux (rated 5.9 by Swain but I bet holds have departed since), and so-so rock detract from a great line. A second pitch is reported in Swain but looks very loose and lame.# Location
Right of Flight Path by about 200yds.# Protection
Pro to 3", 2 bolts
