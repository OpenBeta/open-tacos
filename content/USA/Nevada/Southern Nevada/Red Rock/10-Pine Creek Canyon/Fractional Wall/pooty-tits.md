# Description
Easy climbing on good rock with good protection up a natural line.P1: Climb face and stem up towards a good looking crack. There's an excellent crack to belay from about 10' past the top. 80'P2: Move up the solid column to a pod/ squeeze that only a small child could fit through. Lean back and pull up and out to a steep crack and small roof. 5.6. After the roof the business is over and gear plentiful. Scramble to the top of the formation.# Location
Of the two attractive cracks on the right side of Fractional Wall, Pooty Tits is the left crack system. A lesser quality knotted piece of webbing used as a nut with 2 rope rappel gets you off P2. P1 is rappelled by a slung boulder at the top of the pitch.# Protection
A rack of singles up to 3" is fine. One 4" and 5" cam each could be useful but not necessary.
