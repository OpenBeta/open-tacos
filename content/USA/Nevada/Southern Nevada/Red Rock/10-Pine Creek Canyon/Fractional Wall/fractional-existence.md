# Description
P1: Follow one of two thin cracks to gain the flaring chimney then face climb on solid rock up to a good ledge. Belay off the large flake, not bad. 5.4 120'P2: Steep moves on great jugs launch you off the belay. Face holds continue to appear as you gain the varnished right facing corner. The corner will widen considerably and you will reach a large chockstone. Pull over the boulder and belay off your hip well over the top. 5.5 120'# Location
The center most crack system on Fractional wall.We utilized a walk off descent that was fairly typical down the gully behind Fractional Wall. Some 5th class. It would be possible to rap the route- P2 off the chockstone up top, and P1 off of the belay flake.# Protection
A Rack of singles up to 3".
