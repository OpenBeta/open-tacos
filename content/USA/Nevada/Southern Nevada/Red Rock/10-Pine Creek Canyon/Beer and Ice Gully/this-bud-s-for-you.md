# Description
A stunning looking dihedral system in multicolored rock make this route quite appealing when you look at it. The route starts with an interesting and technical corner, then breaks left to traverse under a roof (crux), then continues left, eventually topping out.# Location
Just past the 4th class section on the right hand wall is an amazing set of cracks. This route ascends the vertical dihedral on the left, then continues up and left.# Protection
Standard rack to 4", Fixed Pro for anchors. Rappel.
