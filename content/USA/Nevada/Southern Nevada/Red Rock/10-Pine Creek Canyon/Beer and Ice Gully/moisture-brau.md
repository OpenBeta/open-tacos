# Description
Great route with mostly good rock. A flaring finger start leads into a short wide section before getting steep. I placed a blue Totem (BD .3) and backed it up with a BD .2 early in the double seams then couldn't find any gear until the horizontal, BD #3.I went up the ramp above looking for an anchor but did not find one. I used the three nut anchor.# Location
Start 30' right of This Beets for You. Obvious left leaning, left facing corner.# Protection
Single rack to 4"
