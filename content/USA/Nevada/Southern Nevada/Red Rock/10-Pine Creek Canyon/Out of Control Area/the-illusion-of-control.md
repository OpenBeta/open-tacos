# Description
This route starts out so good, and then it ends.....well it ends.Start in the wide chimney and climb twin cracks on good rock until the crack peters out.  Above this climb the pleasant arete on solid varnish until the rock shifts back to vertical.The crack provides plenty of protection, but the rock does not inspire confidence.  Well, the rock is bad. But what it lacks in quality, it makes up for in quantity!Finish with a fun top out on a nice ledge.  Belay your second up on any sized gear between .1 and 3".  Walk off climbers left, the same as for Out of Control# Location
On the level below and right of Out of Control are several crack systems.  This one starts in a wide varnished chimney, with double cracks on its left wall.# Protection
Doubles to 3. Single 4 and/or 5. Nuts.  A couple of helmets.
