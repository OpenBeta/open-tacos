# Description
This is a very enjoyable pitch.  Great rock, aesthetic jamming, and nice rests to take in the view.The crack is mostly splitter finger/thin hand jams.  At the top there's a short widening crack which leads up into an A-frame roof.  You need some larger gear here (#3.5  4 Camalot) but dont have to do any real OW moves.  Cool moves lead to a nice belay ledge with rap chains, just above the roof.# Location
# Protection
standard rack to 4".  A couple extra .5 - 1" pieces are useful.
