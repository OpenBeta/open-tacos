# Description
Sea of Holes is a three pitch line at the far left side of the Brass Wall.  It is tough to locate based on Swain's topo, but it is just left of a chimney system with a few bushes in it higher up. The climbing is spicey in spots, but there is ample gear and I don't think it deserves the "R" rating.  Also, it is very easy for the 5.10 grade.  I felt it checked in at 5.9.P1: climb a dirty chimney system to a nice crack and face.  Belay at slings on a ledge.P2: traverse left across huge holes and jugs and pull the roof at the left end through a crack.  Continue up staying fairly close to the lefthand arete for quite a long ways to a single bolt and fixed wire belay.P3: continue straight up for a long pitch of face climbing.  Belay at the very top of a buttress.The raps begin just right of and below the belay at the top of the buttress.  This is on the (climber's) left wall of the gully/chimney system.  Rap down this chimney to the ground - make sure you have two ropes.# Location
