# Description
This a set of twin cracks, but as irony would have it, they top out all too soon.  The climb is up a pleasant crack system which is worthy of attention and merit, but runs for only a single pitch.  A shame, as were this a longer system it would be a classic Red Rocks climb.To locate this route, approach the left side of the Brass Wall. As you do, keep out an eye for a set of twin splitters, starting as a single crack perhaps 10' off of the ground and then splitting and slowly separating along their length.  This route has a little of everything, including a nice solid crux to keep it interesting.From the fixed anchor up top, Rap 70' to the ground on a single rope.# Location
