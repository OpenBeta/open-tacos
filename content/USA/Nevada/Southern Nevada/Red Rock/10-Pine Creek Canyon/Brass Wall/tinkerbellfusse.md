# Description
Pitch 1 (5.8):  Climb up the short chimney to the right of Birdland, above pitch 2 of Birdland.  You can belay here to ease rope drag.  Step down from the top of the chimney to get into a finger crack.  Build an anchor to belay at the top of this crack.Pitch 2 (5.8R/X):  Continue up the crack, as it runs out.  Continue straight up the face, getting some small gear in a small alcove, before running it out on the delicate face for about 50 feet.  Finish at the bolt anchors for pitch 4 of Birdland.Descent:  Same as Birdland.# Location
This route is a variation to the right of Birdland.  Climb the first two pitches of Birdland and then go right up a short chimney (optional belay point) to find the route, instead of going left on the ramp to the bolt.  The route ends at the pitch 4 anchors of Birdland.# Protection
Mostly small gear, especially for the second pitch (got a small BD C3 in before the long runout).
