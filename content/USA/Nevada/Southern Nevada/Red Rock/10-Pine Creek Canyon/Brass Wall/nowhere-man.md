# Description
This route climbs an obvious deep cleft on the far left side of the Brass wall - starting in a cave, exiting the cave by climbing left to right and squeezing out to the outer corner and ascending clean solid rock to a 2 bolt belay 100 feet up. It goes at about 5.8 and is a worthy single pitch route for the grade.The pitch beyond the belay going up and right across the featured rock is loose, dangerous and not worth doing ever again. We abandoned it after about 50 or 60 feet. Other options for a complete direct start look to be possible a bit further to the right.# Location
This route sits on the left side of the Brass wall, to the left of Birdland and Hidden Persuaders. It sits immediately below and slightly left of the second pitch of Hidden Persuaders in a deep cleft - starting in a cave / tunnel and exiting out into the corner about 30 feet up.# Protection
Standard selection of cams from a size 4 Camelot at the bottom to small cams and wires in the crack above.
