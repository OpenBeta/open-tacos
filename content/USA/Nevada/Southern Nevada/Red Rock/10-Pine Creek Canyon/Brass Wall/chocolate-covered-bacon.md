# Description
Chocolate Covered Bacon has a fun, difficult first move followed by enjoyable face climbing utilizing a seam/finger crack for gear.Begin on a bushy ledge as for "Cut Away," a Jay Smith 10d, which is just left of the start of Sea of Holes.Boulder up undercut rock to reach a high bolt (stick clip?) and execute the burly "secret handshake" crux to get established on the heavily varnished face above.  From here, Cut Away heads up and right.  Instead, follow the obvious finger crack up and slightly left across the varnished wall at enjoyable 5.8.  When the crack peters out and the chocolate gives way to the bacon, traverse straight left to the anchors atop Ripcord's first pitch.# Location
