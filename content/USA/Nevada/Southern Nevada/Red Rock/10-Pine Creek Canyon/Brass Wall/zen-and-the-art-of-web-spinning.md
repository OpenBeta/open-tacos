# Description
Start at the far left end of the Brass Wall, as for Arachnoworld, but then come back right perhaps 10 meters to reach a left-facing corner. Just left of this corner climb up a face (a little junky) past a few horizontals to a short crack and a line of pockets that lead to the top of the short wall, perhaps 45 feet in all. Walk off to the left and down.# Location
# Protection
A few large cams to put in pockets on this face. The bottom of the route is a little sparse.
