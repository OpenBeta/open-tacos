# Description
This route is just as good as Birdland...Minus the bolts!1. Start on a boulder making a move or two up to a horizontal.  Trend left following holds to another horizontal. Trend back right on a blank face(crux)toward a crack/corner and up to a belay ledge. Careful placing pro low as rope drag becomes an issue.  This is a heady pitch!2. Move belay under the corner.  Climb the corner and traverse right about 50' and set a belay.3. Climb the hand crack. Set a belay about 40' above its top.4. Zig left from the belay then back right.  Set a belay below the varnish.  This is a short pitch.5. Climb the beautiful face! Set a belay near the top of varnish.6. Head up the varnish until the angle eases into a large ramp.  Set a belay near the top of the ramp.# Location
Approach as per birdland.  From the bottom of birdland scramble up and west until you come to a tunnel.  At the back of the tunnel, boulder up and head west again until you get to a large chasm with a black varnished wall. Boulder up to the start.Getting Down.  Head east toward a small notch passing some old pitons along the way.  Rappel off slung boulders (original bighorn descent) until you can join the birdland rappels.# Protection
Standard rack...C3's were necessary for the first pitch, dolts and a #8 titon for the pitches above!   We climbed the route on double 50's, a 70m single would work for the rappels.
