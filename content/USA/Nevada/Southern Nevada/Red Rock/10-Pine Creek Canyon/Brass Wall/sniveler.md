# Description
Excellent varnished rock with good pro but not much of it.  Not a recommended lead for a 5.6 leader.  I never felt the route was dangerous, but you WILL climb above your protection before getting another piece.The route follows a nice series of hueco ladders up an improbable looking black face.  Easier than it looks, but felt a little harder than Heavy Spider Karma.# Location
To the left of Heavy Spider Karma.  Start on a boulder, high step right onto the face.  Once at the top of the wall, either head way right to the Topless Twins bolted anchor, or there was some webbing around a boulder to the left to rap from.# Protection
.5 to 2.5" cams (1 ea.) and a set of nuts and slings.
