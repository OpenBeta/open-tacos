# Description
There were no spiders noted on this odd route when we did it.The climb is up a strange but pleasant crack and face system. While the gear is not always the best, it's good enough to be safe and the climb is pretty positive, if not outright juggy.To locate this route, start by noting the twin splitters on the left end, 'Topless Twins' and then look slightly left to a dark crack and flake system going up and slightly left for perhaps 70 or 80' to a ledge. This is the route Heavy Spider Karma.Climb up the route, placing pieces in the odd crack here and there until the crack widens to an offwidth. Cut back right onto the face doing an easy rising traverse to the anchors above 'Topless Twins.'# Location
