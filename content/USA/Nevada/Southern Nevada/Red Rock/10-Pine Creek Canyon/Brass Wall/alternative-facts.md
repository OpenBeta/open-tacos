# Description
Thin climbing up a corner  with interesting body movement protected by small gear leads to a short thin hands crack that protects well. Continue on the left face and corner past a short run-out to more opportunities for gear.  Then head on up to the last obstacle, an awkward left facing corner with good gear in the corner, that deposits you on a ledge. Although there are a couple of rests, the climbing is physical and engaging.# Location
The pitch climbs above the second pitch anchor to No Laughing Matter and Serious Business.# Protection
I took doubles from .3 BD to 2, and a single 3 that was useful for the anchor. I also took metolius 00 to 1, a green alien and a small off-set. I took a set of nuts but not sure if I placed any. Because of a few short run outs, I doubled up on gear at a few points. With the bolts in place, I would image you could cut back by 25-35%. There are now five pro-bolts and a two bolt anchor on the top.
