# Description
The route begins under the crack that splits the middle of the Brass Wall Left face and runs into the right side of a bushy ledge.  Start underneath a large boulder.Pitches 1 and 2 (5.7) follow the first two pitches of Birdland up the crack to a ledge and then up (or next to, depending on how you are feeling) the chimney system to a large bushy ledge.  Bolted anchors.Pitch 3 (5.3):  Scramble left up some bouldery pillar features to the base of the enormous right-facing corner at the bottom of the obvious crack and build a trad anchor.  50 feet.Pitch 4 (5.8):  Climb the crack through the center of the varnished face.  It starts wide and narrows to hand size before running into a lip, which forms the short crux of the climb with good hands but little feet.  Finish up as the crack narrows to finger size with good face holds to a bolted anchor and rap slings.  This pitch is the reason to climb this route!Pitches 5 and 6 (5.7 R):  Not recommended.  Climb the face to the top of the cliff.Rappel with 2 ropes.# Location
# Protection
Standard Red Rock rack to a number 3 camalot.  I found a set of nuts very useful on this climb.
