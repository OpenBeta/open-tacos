# Description
P1 (5.5, 70'): Start about 30' left of Birdland on a pedestal of tan rock.  Pull onto the black varnished face and continue up easy terrain with nice cracks for pro to a two bolt anchor in a notch at a good stance.P2 (10b, 100'): Pull onto the brown varnished face, just right of the belay, moving past a bolt and up to a stance at a right facing flake under chunky rock.  Climb through the chunky rock on nice holds, where pro may be sparse, to a horizontal with pockets for a hand-sized cam.  Move up using a nice varnished seam, then left and up through the crux passing a bolt and mantling onto a nice stance at the base of a left sweeping crescent.  Walk the crescent up and left clipping two bolts and eventually exiting left toward the edge of the face. Continue up the left edge of the face trending back right over nice varnish to a two bolt anchor.Vol. 2 of the Red Rocks guidebook has a misleading picture that shows Psycho Date (10d) following the first half of Birdlaw's 2nd pitch.  Pyscho Date starts 20' to the right at the Birdland 2nd belay and follows the right edge of the face.# Location
