# Description
While lowering off of Mushroom People, I looked left. What a line! Why wasn't it in the guidebook!?  I looked for anchors up top, but there weren't any. Half way up I noticed an ancient piece of tat hanging from the ceiling. Of course. Too obvious. Crap! Stiffed for the FA once again...Follow runout boulder problem start(10c R) up and left to a left facing flake and a plated face to a ledge. Head straight up finger crack/seam and either finish at the tat(replace or put in some anchors?); or do like I did and traverse(9R) to Mushrooms Anchors to rap.  In between the top of both routes is a HUGE 10' x 10' hueco.# Location
