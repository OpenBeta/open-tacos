# Description
The hardest part of this route is getting to the start of it!  I found that surmounting the steep bit at the bottom was a bit harder than the 5.7+ rating, but you can get a good nut or two in.Follow the left-leaning crack til it ends, and then three bolts to the top.# Location
As of 2006, this is the furthest right route in the Flight Path area.  It starts about 35 feet right of the huge right-facing corner.# Protection
Trad gear, three bolts on the face, and a shared fixed anchor at the top that you can rap or lower from.
