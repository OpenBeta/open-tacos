# Description
This route is eye catching even though it kinda blends into the cliff.  The rock is also SUSPECT at times but careful climbing allows safe passage.  Starts up a low angle corner ramp with some cool gear placements if you can find them.  Clip a bolt and midway anchor before embarking up an open corner overhanging on both sides.  Mostly sporty but some critical jams appear necessary.  Place gear carefully to avoid fragile rock.  Gets progressively harder the higher you go.I lowered with a 70 meter.  Not sure if you can get down with a 60.If someone knows the name of this route let me know and I'l update the name.# Location
found on the right section of the Flight Path area.  climb 3rd class blocks to a nice flat area.  climb is in the obvious recess# Protection
fingers to cupped hands.  a strong climber can probably get by w/ a single rack
