# Description
This is the left of the two routes higher up that top out on the true summit of Raptor Tower, and also happens to be pitch 3 of the full "Raptor Tower" route. It begins at the anchors for F-15 Eagle Crack and F-16 Fighting Falcon. From the anchors, climb up and right on 4th class terrain for 25 feet or so, going around a small but easy bulge. From here, make a quick move back left to stand on top of a large ledge.This is where there is a fun and burly couple of 5.9 moves. Look up and climb the steep headwall with decent hands on the right side of the wall, but with bad feet. After pulling these couple of burly moves, continue up on steep but positive holds until reaching the top.Don't be fooled into stopping too short of the very top. Once reaching what seems to be a natural stopping point, if you fail to continue up and to the right on white rock towards what seems to be more of the true summit of Raptor Tower, you will be faced with some weird and difficult scrambling around some huge blocks to get to the top.One may descend via rappel from the top of F-22 Raptor or via a fun and easy scramble which begins from the north side of the summit or raptor tower and winds back down the east face down to Eagle Ledge.# Location
