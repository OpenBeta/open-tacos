# Description
This route is going to need a lot of cleaning up. The redeeming quality of this route is it is exposed and takes you to the true summit of Raptor Tower. Begin by climbing on easy moves towards the obvious cleft in a small roof in the skyline. Before arriving at the cleft, navigate around a small ledge with lots of rotten and loose rock by going slightly right on better rock. This pitch may end up getting better with lots of traffic, but overall worth climbing merely to get to the top of Raptor Tower.# Location
The route starts just to the left of the top of F-117 Stealth Nighthawk up on Eagle Ledge. This is near the far right side of Eagle ledge. Look for the obvious weakness in the face where a cleft cuts through a small roof above.# Protection
