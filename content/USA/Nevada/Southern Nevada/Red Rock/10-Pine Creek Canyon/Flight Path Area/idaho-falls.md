# Description
On the far left of the Flight Path wall there are 4 parallel hand cracks each about 25’ tall.   The climbing wall looks like it has the shape of Idaho on it.  This route is third from left.  The crack is the left leaning crack that forms the shape of Idaho.   It starts as 3” fists and becomes more featured as you go up.   Thr hardest part is getting off the ground.  The route tops out at a tree with slings and rap rings.  Careful of the loose rock.# Location
