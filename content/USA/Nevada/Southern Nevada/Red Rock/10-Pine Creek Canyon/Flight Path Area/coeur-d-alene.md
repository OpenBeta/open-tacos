# Description
On the far left of the Flight Path wall there are 4 parallel hand cracks each about 25’ tall.   The climbing wall looks like it has the shape of Idaho on it.  This route is the far left crack.  The crack starts as finger tips and becomes more featured as you go up.   The route tops out at a tree with slings and rap rings. This is probably the easiest of the 4 cracks.# Location
As looking at the wall, this route is left of Commuted Sentence.# Protection
