# Description
On the far left of the Flight Path wall there are 4 parallel hand cracks each about 25’ tall.   The climbing wall looks like it has the shape of Idaho on it.  This route is the second from left crack.  The crack is very parallel around 2” and becomes more featured as you go up.   The route tops out at a tree with slings and rap rings.# Location
# Protection
Paired down rack in the hand sizes.  A 5” cam will protect the top wide crack if you have one but it’s optional.
