# Description
On the far left of the Flight Path wall there are 4 parallel hand cracks each about 25’ tall.   The climbing wall looks like it has the shape of Idaho on it.  This route is the far right crack.  Start on the ground.   Lay back the crack or jam to gain the crack.   Perfect hand jams will get you to the wider section.  Hand stack or use the crimps to top out.   The route tops out at a tree with slings and rap rings.# Location
