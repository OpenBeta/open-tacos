# Description
Perhaps the best route in this section.  Some routefinding is needed.  Careful getting to the first bolt--if you slip, it's a long way down!Climb the face of the huge right-facing corner, past five bolts, to near the top, where it goes left around the arete.# Location
To get down, a seventy-meter rope (or doubles) is probably needed, unless you want to rap to the end of a sixty-meter rope, and then scramble down the bottom of the Man Behind the Screen crack/corner.# Protection
