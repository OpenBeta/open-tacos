# Description
An underrated and overlooked sister climb to nearby Straight Shooter, with everything including tips crack, flaky face, hand jams, a roof, a mantel, and easy-off chain anchors. Easy to toprope two other climbs on this face from same anchors. My partner felt this was 10a on toprope, I felt it was solid 9 and worth 3+ stars, not the *1* listed in the B/McM book.# Location
Flight Path Area encompasses enough ground to house 25 Starbucks if the property was on West Charleston; this particular spot is a rope length to the right of the right boundary of the Stick gully-maybe a ten minute walk from Straight Shooter.# Protection
Standard rack w/extra small cams
