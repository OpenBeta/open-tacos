# Description
The Right Stuff is a wild route that climbs a series of enormous flakes on the left side of the Challenger Wall.  Care must be taken when climbing and protecting this route.Begin about 50' left of Challenger at a small left-facing corner.  Climb these corners and grooves to an obvious roof/undercling crack.  Jam out the left side of this and work up and left on a horizontal.  Gingerly mantle up to a massive flake and climb the right side of it (increasingly more solid sounding).  At the top, hand traverse left and step up into an obvious right-facing corner.  Protect and climb a punchy crux to a good cam in a horizontal and make one last mantle onto a ledge.  Belay here or lower to the ground.There is a second pitch (5.10a) that continues up the right-facing corner above to a wide roof with a large chockstone.# Location
