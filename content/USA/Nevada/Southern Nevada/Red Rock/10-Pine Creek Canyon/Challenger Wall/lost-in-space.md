# Description
The Lost in Space finish is a classic final pitch variation to Jupiter 2, adding more quality 5.11+ climbing to an already stacked route. Instead of climbing the standard last pitch of Jupiter 2 (a hand crack in a flare), step left and climb the steep fingers lieback immediately next to it. Well-protected but punchy climbing leads to a rest where one can momentarily step right before once again committing to the lefthand system via an exciting crux. Finish at the shared anchor above.Reminiscent of a Flagstaff, AZ basalt pitch and highly recommended!# Location
Are you climbing Challenger? Continue with the original finish of Jupiter 2 for a superb 5-6 pitch day of consistent 5.10+ climbing.Are you climbing Jupiter 2? Instead of the original last pitch, do the Lost in Space finish for another great pitch of 5.11+ climbing.# Protection
The same rack you have for Jupiter 2 is adequate: A single run from roughly blue Alien to #1 Camalot and a few larger RP's or smaller nuts.
