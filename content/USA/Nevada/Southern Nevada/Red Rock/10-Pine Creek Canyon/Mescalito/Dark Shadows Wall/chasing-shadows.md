# Description
Chasing Shadows is a fun P3/4 variation to Dark Shadows that is worth doing if DS is crowded or after rapping down. Head up and right from the P2 anchors on DS into the right most of the two cracks.  Follow a fun hand crack to a wide section with some poor/loose rock.  Place your number 4 C4 and have a #3 ready.  Face climb around the OW crack to a varnised wall above.  A tiny cam protects the final runout moves to a two bolt rap anchor.  The second pitch heads up for a few bolts and then traverse out right past 3 bolts.  Easier runout climbing leads to the two anchor on Edge Dressing.# Location
Shares the first two pitches of Dark Shadows, and heads right for pitches 3 and 4.# Protection
