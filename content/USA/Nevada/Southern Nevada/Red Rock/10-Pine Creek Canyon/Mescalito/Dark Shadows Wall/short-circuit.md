# Description
Begin just right of Parental Guidance on a long block forming a ledge at the base of the wall.  Mantle up to an excellent small TCU placement, then make a difficult move past this to a stance.  A crucial #1 Camalot overhead can be placed (height dependent) before pulling up into the undercling allows clipping of the first of five bolts. Continue upwards with a thin high-step/mantle, and finally thin but positive edges to the anchor.This route previously featured a fixed pin which has been gone for some time now. Because the #1 Camalot is behind a semi-hollow flake and shorter climbers may not even be able to place this cam to begin with, I believe this route *could* be R-rated. If you're tall enough, and if the cam holds, then it's totally G-rated.# Location
# Protection
0.3 Camalot, #1 Camalot, 5 bolts, bolted anchor.
