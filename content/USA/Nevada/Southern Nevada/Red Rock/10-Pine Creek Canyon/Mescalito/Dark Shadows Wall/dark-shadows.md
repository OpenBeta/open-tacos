# Description
A great route to get out of the sun. There is a little stream that you can hang out by and jump over to get to the rock in the spring. Your rope will hit the water on the way down if you don't take care. You can rap with a single 60 m rope using the anchor of Chasing Shadows/Edge Dressing. No need for 2 60m ropes.P1- 5.5s two good bolts to the anchor on the first pitchP2- (P1 & P2) can be done as one pitch(170 ft). Take the right facing desert varnished dihedral from the bolt anchor (5.7; 60 ft), move left to the the belay anchors.P3- 5.8 from the anchor continue up the great crack system with some stemming to another anchor (120 ft)P4- 5.8 from the anchor break out right onto the curving crack and follow it to the final anchor beneath the giant roof.Careful on the way down not to get the ropes caught in the crack as you rap.# Location
# Protection
Pro is great. All anchors are bolts. There are 2 bolts on the 5.5s first pitch. Camalots 0.3-#3 and a set of wire nuts
