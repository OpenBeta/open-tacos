# Description
Sandstone Sandwich is a mostly bolted pitch between Excellent Adventure (shares anchors with it) and Dark Shadows.  See Excellent Adventure's description for more details.Start from the boulder where Dark Shadows starts and then traverse in on a ledge above the pool.  Climb up the water polished slab past two modern bolts to an overlap/roof.  Place gear here and pull onto the steep, beautiful face above.  Head up past more bolts, generally trending to the left, to an anchor.# Location
# Protection
A bunch of quickdraws and a very light rack.
