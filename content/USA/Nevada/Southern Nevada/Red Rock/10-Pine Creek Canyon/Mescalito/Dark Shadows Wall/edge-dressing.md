# Description
This is a great variation to Chasing Shadows on fun black varnish climbing.  Head up the right most of the two cracks from the P2 anchor on Dark Shadows.  You will pass an optional belay on your right.  Continue up the technical face climbing clipping bolts along the way on black varnish to a two bolt rap anchor.  There is a mini crux in the leaning corner and a final thin crux before the anchors. Rap 4 times with a 60M rope to the ground.When P3/4 are combined, this is a classic 190ft lead.# Location
