# Description
This route was recommended in the old Urioste guide--in 1987 for this reason we elected to climb it instead of Crimson Chrysalis.  The problem is that the rock is poor on the crux pitch, making for a freaky pitch.  After that the climb is easier, but much bushwhacking and crumbly rock will be found.  There are no fixed anchors on this route.From the parking lot a prominent white tower can be seen on the right side of Mescalito (called Perception Tower).  This tower appears in the photo below, it's top is white and in the sun.  The route follows cracks that form the left side of this tower.  The crux (3rd?) pitch involves white rock, an old bolt, flexy flakes and questionable pro.  About 6-8 pitches to the top of Perception Tower.  From here find a way through the bushes and ledges to the top of Mescalito (3-4 more pitches).  Scramble NW (with a few rappels) back down into Pine Creek (1-2 hours).# Location
