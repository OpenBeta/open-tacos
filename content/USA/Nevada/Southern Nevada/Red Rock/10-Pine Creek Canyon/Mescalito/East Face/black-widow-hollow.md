It is to the left of Cookie Monster.pitch 1: go up an easy chimney and belay at a small tree on the right side.pitch 2: continue up the crack. Sustained climbing up squeeze chimneys and cracks goes past several cruxes. Ultimately a smooth chimney leads to a huge ledge on the crest of the ridge.pitch 3: Turn right and climb a pleasant (and comparatively relaxed) crack on the crest of the ridge. From the large belay ledge at its top, scramble down and west (class 3) to rappel anchors on Cat in the Hat.# Location

Surprisingly, not much need for big gear; in fact most big gear will not be big enough.  Fortunately there are options for a variety of gear from small to hand or fist size.  Bring a bunch of this stuff.
