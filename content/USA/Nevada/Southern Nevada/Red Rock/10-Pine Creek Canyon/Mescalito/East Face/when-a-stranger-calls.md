Fun climbing, memorable second pitch, classic old school with not a bolt in sight. Enjoyed myself thoroughly on this one. Nice sunny route, good winter tick.# Location
Attractive crack/corner system to the right of Pine Nuts. Buy a guidebook, fer chrissake!# Protection
Single rack & a couple hexes work fine
