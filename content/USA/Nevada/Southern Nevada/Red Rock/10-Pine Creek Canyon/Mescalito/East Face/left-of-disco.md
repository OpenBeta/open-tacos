# Description
Follow the arete to the left of This Ain't No Disco.  The first bolt is a little high but the climbing is positive. Pass a small roof and crack system and a few more bolts to the shared anchors on Disco. As with Disco, there are a few runouts even with the gear placements.Rap with a 70M...# Location
