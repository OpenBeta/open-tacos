# Description
The crack system 10' left of Splitting Hares. There are several options that will get you to a cleft about 75' off the ground. Build a belay in the cleft. Follow the crack system up to the roof. I did not pull the roof but stayed just below it and traversed right on the horizontals. This kept all the climbing at 5.7. Rappel with two ropes from top of Next Century.# Location
On the NE side of Mescalito between Y2K and Next Century.# Protection
A standard trad rack.
