# Description
Air temperatures rose well past 100 degrees on the day of the first ascent, but the chimney stayed cool -- hence the route's name.  Offbeat and varied, moderate climbing.  See Urioste guide for a photo showing the approximate location.Begin in a deep chimney on the NE side of Mescalito.  After two pitches of easy climbing, the chimney widens.Pitch 3 -- Stem the wide chimney to reach a jam crack on the right wall, pass a small roof and belay (5.9).Pitch 4 -- Face climbing leads up and left to a shelf.  Belay below an offwidth crack (5.9).  An old piton, predating the first ascent, used to exist on this pitch.Pitch 5 -- The offwidth crack.Easier climbing continues for hundreds of feet, eventually moving left into a long hand-sized crack.  One final pitch achieves the summit of Mescalito.# Location
