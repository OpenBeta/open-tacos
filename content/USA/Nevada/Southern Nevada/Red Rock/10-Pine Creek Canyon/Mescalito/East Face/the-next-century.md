# Description
The Next Century is on the northern end of the east face of the Mescalito in Pine Creek, to the right of Y2K. The first pitch is 5.8, is surprisingly fun and short, and ends at a bolted anchor. The second pitch is a nice long 5.10 with a few bolts, 3 I believe. The face climbing is sustained on beautiful chocolate sandstone and the pitch is not recommended for the faint of heart. The pitch ends at another bolted anchor. Tom Moulin and I simul-rapped off of 8 m lines and, with rope stretch, reached the ground with 2-3 feet to spare. Recommended.# Location
# Protection
A few bolts, 3, I think. The rest was smaller gear with a few nuts. I don't think I placed anything larger than a #1 cam on the second pitch. Maybe some larger gear for the first pitch.
