# Description
This route is listed in Supertopo as This Ain't No Disco, but according to Handren, that route is around right on the other side of the pillar.  Other than that, the Supertopo information seems pretty accurate.Diagonal up left across an easy apron, pull an overhang on somewhat sketchy rock, then wander up varnish to the thread anchor of When a Stranger Calls.  No fixed protection.Unfortunately, the rock quality at the crux is poor.  The varnished face above is nicer, but never really makes up for the lackluster start.# Location
East face of Mescalito, immediately right of When a Stranger Calls, starting from an obvious ledge just right of the bushes.# Protection
Standard rack to 3".  Threaded horns for the belay/rappel anchor at the top; consider bringing extra cord or webbing.  Two-rope rappel.
