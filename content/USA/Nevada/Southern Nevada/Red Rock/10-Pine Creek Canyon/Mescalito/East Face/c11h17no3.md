Layback and stem up the chimney, using the crack in the right corner, to a ledge with bushes(optional belay).  Hand traverse left into the corner and build a belay. For the left-corner anchor, a couple very small micro-cams might help as well as climbing up a move or two to place a reassuringly larger piece. 180' 5.7P2 Upward via flakes and the large right facing corner.
