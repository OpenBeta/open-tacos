# Description
This is a good climb up twin cracks just right of OB Button. Using both a wide crack on the left (hands to OW) and a thin crack in the corner to the right, work up to a high roof. Perfect hands and face holds through the roof (crux) leads to easier ground and a shared anchor with OB Button. I think this is the better route of the two but they are both great.Originally rated 5.9.# Location
Walk up the wash for 5 minutes past Cat in the Hat.Use the photo to ID the routes from the wash below.Continue past the routes 100-200 yards and then scramble up ramps and ledges back right towards the routes. Your passage will eventually be blocked by an interesting chimney (visible from the wash) lined with huecos: Climb up this at 5.0 and then scramble around the corner to the right to the start of the routes.# Protection
