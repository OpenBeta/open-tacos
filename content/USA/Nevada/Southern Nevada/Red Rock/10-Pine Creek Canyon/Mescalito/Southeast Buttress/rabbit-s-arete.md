# Description
This route climbs the nice looking arete above the 3rd pitch belay on Cat in the Hat.  Head up on easy ground to the high first bolt.  From here things get extremely technical as you work your way up the arete.  After getting past the second bolt things ease up to the anchor, it stays interesting as the bolts are widely spaced.If continuing on to the anchor of Cat in the Hat, continue up through low angle chossy rock past a bolt to the anchor.  Here you can get some supplementary protection with small nuts and cams in the soft rock.# Location
Directly above the belay after pitch 3 on Cat in the Hat.# Protection
4 or 5 Bolts to Anchors.  Can get a piece in before the first bolt if wanted.  I didn't see any obvious placements for gear higher on the route, but maybe take some small nuts.  I gave this a trad rating rather than a sport as you should probably be solid at the grade for this one.
