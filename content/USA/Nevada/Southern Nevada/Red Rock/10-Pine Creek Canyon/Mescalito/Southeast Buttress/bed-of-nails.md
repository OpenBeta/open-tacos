# Description
This fun chimney is the first wide crack to the right of Cat in the Hat.  One pitch takes you up to join CITH to the right of that route's first belay.The route is well named for an interesting section of calcite crystals on the wall of the chimney.The route was originally rated 5.7 by the first ascent party. It feels significantly harder than 5.7 if you lack big gear nearby.# Location
While waiting to climb Cat in the Hat, walk right from that route 50 feet to this chimney.The crux involves chimneying out a bomb bay slot with what feels like big air below.# Protection
The FA party took and used cams to 12 inches as well as two #4 Big Bros.
