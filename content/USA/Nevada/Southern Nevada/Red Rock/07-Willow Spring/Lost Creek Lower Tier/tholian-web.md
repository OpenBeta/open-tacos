# Description
Old route named after Star Trek episode. Since this is an ancient adventure route, I'm not going to betamax anyone, just heads up and enjoy it. Safer and easier than the route to the right. Rock's decent, not a real classic but a fun one-time deal and interesting to picture putting up pre-cams.# Location
Just left of Bowling Balls and BB Brains, starts in a bushy area, not a lot of traffic# Protection
Single rack.
