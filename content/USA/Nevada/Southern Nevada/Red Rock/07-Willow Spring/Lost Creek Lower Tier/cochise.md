# Description
This route climbs the left leaning wide crack of mixed quality to the top of the buttress.  A good way to apply basic wide technique.  Some might avoid this climb, but you're not like them are you?  You're a unique and beautiful butterfly.# Location
Opposite side of canyon from Black Track.# Protection
Single #1-#4 and doubles #5 #6 camalots is what I used
