# Description
This is a great route that you have to climb. Pretty stout. Fun crack climbing down low, tricky crux mid-way up, follow the corner to a roof and a few psychological moves on to the face above. Take the faint crack right and up to the top of the cliff.# Location
This route is 50-100 feet to the right of Hidden Falls. Descend by rapping from a two bolt anchor about 20 feet left of the top out or as per the standard Lower Tier descent.# Protection
Standard rack. Build your own anchor.
