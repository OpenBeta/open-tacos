# Description
This is a fun slab climb on black varnish rock. A lot of 5.5 and 5.6 climbing with perhaps a few 5.7 moves. For being a new route, the rock quality is quite good, although there may be a little cleaning up to do, especially near the top. There are short run outs in spots, but the easy/moderate nature of the vast majority of the climb makes it manageable for the competent leader at the grade.P1: Climb the small left facing corner until it turns into a face climb. Place pro mainly in horizontal cracks. Build a belay 150 feet up on a super comfy ledge big enough to fit several people, slightly higher than the belay ledge for Dauntless Dihedral which is 20 feet to the right.P2: Continue face climbing on black varnish until reaching a spot 50 feet from the top of the wall where one can either climb on an arete on the left up to the summit on 5. easy terrain or can continue straight up the face on what looks like 5.11 terrain.# Location
20 feet to the left of the main left facing dihedral on the far right side of the wall. Begins in a much smaller left facing corner.# Protection
Standard Rack up to 3"
