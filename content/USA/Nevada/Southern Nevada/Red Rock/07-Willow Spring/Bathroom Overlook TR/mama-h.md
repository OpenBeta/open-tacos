# Description
No real crux, maybe the top out.  Pretty easy, sustained the whole climb.  I didn't want to scramble from the side to setup top rope so I followed the crack to the left of "Unnamed" Bathroom overlook climb.As a newer trad climber it was a bit tricky to find protection.  Set of nuts or small cams up to #2 worked fine for me.  I placed 4-5 pieces.The 2 bolted anchor for the TR "Unnamed" climb is to the right of the top out and is about 5 feet from the edge.  Bring long cords or slings if you're planning on setting up TR.# Location
Behind the Restrooms next to the picnic benches.  Scramble right of the restrooms up to a big flat ledge.# Protection
Set of nuts, Cams up to #2.  2 bolt anchor with rings.
