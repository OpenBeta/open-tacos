# Description
Great beginners route. Multiple routes can be taken with little risk of dangerous pendulum. Low angle at the bottom and becoming steeper at the top. One must carry all the gear up to set up the TR and one must break down the TR and hike back down. This route should not be rapped and have the rope pulled over the lip (it would eat your rope too). No Grooves have been cut into the lip of this climb and the anchor has been here for a couple of years. The route sees little traffic and it would be nice to keep it as pristine as possible.-This Route will need a long extension to run the master point over the lip.# Location
Once the TR is set up. Climbers can take a well defined trail, from all the day hikers, behind the bathrooms. Look for ropes that have been set up, walking directly toward the cliff, taking path or least resistance. Note, access is not good if starting from under the large overhang near the picnic area, it is best to walk to the south side of the Bathroom and then start working ones way toward the base of the cliffs.# Protection
