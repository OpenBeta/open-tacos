# Description
There are several open books on the right side of Children's Crag;  Stemming Corner ascends the middle corner.  The line is drawn incorrectly in Handren's guide, but he directs you to start at green graffiti, which gets you to the right place.Wander your way up into the main open-book system, and stem your way up that to a ledge with a tree (slings) or to the top and walk off.# Location
