# Description
A very fun route that looks much more intimidating than it is. A little run out at the beginning. The crux is at the very top where you pull up through a short, slightly overhung, offwidth.# Location
This route has the same starting point as Tarzan's Arm, but instead of following the right leaning crack, you head straight up to the obvious corner. You can build an anchor directly at the top in a short vertical crack about 1' back from the edge, or, with a directional, around the corner to the right.Walk off to the right as with all other Childrens Crag climbs.# Protection
Nuts and cams to #3 Friend. a couple of 4.5 Camalots are very handy for building the anchor.
