# Description
Take the Petroglyph Wall Trail to the interpretive sign at the base of the crag. About 30 feet left of this area, Peaches goes up the prominent right leaning dihedral that is capped by a roof. Climb straight up this dihedral and then escape right around the overhang. The closest escape on the right goes at 5.7, go further right for the 5.5 route. You can take on the 5.9 variation by going left at the roof and doing a sweet, pumpy lieback up the overhanging crack. This climb is well protected and has good rock quality. Walk off right.# Location
