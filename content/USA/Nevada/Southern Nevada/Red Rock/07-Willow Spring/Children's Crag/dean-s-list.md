# Description
One of the classic friction routes in Red Rocks. Right up there with Smears for Fears and Rojo. Bring a couple of small cams to protect the opening moves to the first bolt. If you're under 5'10" clipping the first bolt will be hard and scary. Traverse left a bit then make hard moves to the slopy ledge. Rest the feet here you're going to need it. The next section traverses back right a bit and up on very thin slab. A couple of very shallow solution pockets will hopefully get you past the crux without taking the long whip.Holds have broken off making the grade a bit harder than 5.11# Location
The right hand route.# Protection
3 bolts and a couple of small cams.
