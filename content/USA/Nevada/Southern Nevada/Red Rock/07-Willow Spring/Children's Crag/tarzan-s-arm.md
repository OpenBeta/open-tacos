# Description
This route goes up the face and traverses right under a nose shaped roof into the slot on the right side. It is about 15 feet left of Sumo Greatness and about forty feet right of the petroglyph interpretive sign at the base of Children's Crag. Pulling the crux is pretty fun. Build a gear anchor at the top and walk off right. The rock quality is a little flaky on this route.# Location
# Protection
Standard rack to Camalot #4. A second #4 or a #4.5 or a #5 could come in handy at the crux.
