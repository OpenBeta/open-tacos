# Description
Climb a short arete past two bolts (stick clip the first one!) to gain the namesake flake. Climb the flake with difficulty, passing another bolt and optional gear placements, and execute a big move (crux). Clip a final bolt, move right, and follow jugs and sparse pro to the top of the wall.The anchor is a slung tree set way back from the wall which might make top-roping problematic.# Location
Go to Nadia's Nine. Scramble up a very bushy gully to the right of Nadia's Nine to gain access to a higher wall. There are two routes on this wall - Wheat Thick is on the right.# Protection
A set of cams from small to #2 Camalot. A #4 Camalot is very useful. No stoppers or RP's required.
