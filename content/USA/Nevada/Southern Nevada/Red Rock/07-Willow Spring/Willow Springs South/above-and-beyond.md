# Description
Tip toe right of the crack on a thin rail, grab the pockets and SMEAR! Thus begins the enjoyable movement that is Above and Beyond. Follow the pockets left and right of the crack, then reach way out right to swing into the large hueco. Continue up and slightly left through the thin plates, then easily to the top.Same anchor spot as Chocolate Tranquility Fountain.Fun, technical climbing on some very nice varnish makes this beautiful route a fine bonus after climbing Pillar Talk below it.# Location
Located above Pillar Talk, next to Chocolate Tranquility Fountain.Descent is the same as for CTF# Protection
Single rack to #3 Camalot (Yes, the #3 goes in passive mode in a hole by the big hueco)nutstrad anchor
