# Description
This route goes out the obvious splitter crack in the 15-20ft roof just south and east of the parking lot. The roof is very obvious. To acess the roof scramble up an easy 5th class gully, climbers left, some people will want a belay up this section. There is a good ledge at the start of the roof, you'll want a small selection of gear to build an anchor here. climb out the Fist crack doing approximately 3 fist moves before gaining jugs.Descend by going south and east to the obvious gully- it's a walk off.# Location
