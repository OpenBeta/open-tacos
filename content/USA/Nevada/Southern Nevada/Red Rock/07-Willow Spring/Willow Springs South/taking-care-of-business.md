# Description
Ascend the crack/seam through a couple of bulges to a point where the crack dwindles and it is possible to cast out right and up on white stone with no protection.  Another lost opportunity for a really good route!  The addition of a couple of bolts to extend this route up the bulge and into the next crack system would produce a fine route that many could enjoy.  As it is now, the finish is sure to dissuade most.# Location
This route is located on the Super Ultra Mega cliff which is above the Supra Ultra cliff.  This route ascends the long crack/seam located on the left side of the cliff.# Protection
Single rack to 4 inches.  Build an anchor at the top.
