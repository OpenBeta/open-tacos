# Description
Cool route with a short chimney section on Pitch 4. I remember doing a few runouts but the climbing is easy. Somewhat wandering but not to bad. There are no bolts or fixed anchors on this route. Quality rock in a good location and a relatively short approach. The route goes up the center of the left half of the wall.# Location
This route is located on the wall joined directly right(when facing west)of Bighorn buttress. On the left side of the wall, left of the huge chasm/chimney deal in the middle.Follows a line of cracks, corners and depressions in the face up toward a big corner up high.We descended by scrambling down slabs and sheep trails to the north east.# Protection
Trad. Single rack of cams from 00 to 3".No bolts/fixed anchors.
