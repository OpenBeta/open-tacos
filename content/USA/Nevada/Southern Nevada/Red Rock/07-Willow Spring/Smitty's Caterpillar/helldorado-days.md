# Description
Begin directly under the roof crack (that eventually splits the caterpillar) at a low angle tips crack. Up the tips crack. Go slightly left around the first small roof, then traverse directly right under the larger roof to the obvious crack system. Take this crack (steep initially) to the top, climbing through the center of the caterpillar feature. The tips crack, exposed under the roof traverse, and steep jug haul crack make this a very worthwhile climb.# Location
The most obvious, snaking crack system, that pulls through the roof on the east aspect of the formation. Walk off to the south.# Protection
Standard single rack. Runners. Build an anchor on top.
