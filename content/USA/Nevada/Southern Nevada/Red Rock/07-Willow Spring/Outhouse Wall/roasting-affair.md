# Description
Climb the initial easiness shared with Spiderline, build an anchor on hand-size cams on the left end of the ledge. Climb left, heading up to a (now) fat bolt on decent but thin holds. Climb the face above, looking intently for gear, then slab it out to the shared top ledge/tree with Spiderline. A heady, old-school route, but at least the bolt's good-it was solidly X-rated when I lead this on the original paper-thin SMC hanger and a shorty quarter-incher that left a long rust streak to remember it by. Thanks to the ASCA for the replacement.# Location
Same start as Spiderline, walk the initial ledge left to anchor to start the route.# Protection
Falling off prior to clipping the bolt would be a bad idea, but the crux comes afterward, on thin, flexing, crunchy holds. Some finger-size gear up higher helps you relax as the angle relents. Single rack and a long sling (4') for the tree up top keeps the sap off your rope.
