# Description
This is a short but steep, varied crack with enjoyable yet strenuous jamming close to the road.  The rock quality, for the most part, is good very solid.  Follow the obvious crack to the right of the corner proper (the crack system closer to the road, it is fairly obvious) to the top.  Make athletic moves up and then pull over the final moves and wander up low angle rock to an anchor tree.# Location
To find this route, look at the Outhouse Wall from the parking lot.  Locate the second tier of the cliff with a ramp system coming into it from the left.  Follow this ramp system up and to the base of the climb.  Jerry Handren's guide has an excellent beta photo for this.# Protection
