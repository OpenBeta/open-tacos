Climb crack and face to its right up to ledge.  Climb featured face near the left edge of the black varnish through a small bulge at the very top (easy).Climbing is usually positive, but the pro is thoughtful.# Location
About 75' directly above the outhouse.  Starts at a wide crack in a dihedral.Walk off to climber's right(?) or rappel (60m will almost reach) off tree.# Protection
Wide gear (#3, 4 Camalots) can be used in the lower crack.  Mostly wired nuts in the patina for the upper face.
