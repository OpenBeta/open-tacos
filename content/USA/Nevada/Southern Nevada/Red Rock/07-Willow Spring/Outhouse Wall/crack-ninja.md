# Description
This is the obvious second pitch to Karate Crack. From the top of that route, move left around the corner and climb the righthand leaning flake to a big move, then continue up the easier, pretty dihedral to an anchor.This is a stout line - a bit sandy but good, bouldery fun. Finger size and ability to power-lieback will likely shift the grade one way or the other in the 5.12 spectrum.# Location
# Protection
1x small to #2 Camalot. An extra #2 Camalot. No wires needed. You may wish to aid up the initial crack and place a #2 Camalot at the top of the flake to protect the first 15' of the climb which are the crux.
