# Description
This beautiful line soaks up the sun in Willow Springs. It features tricky double finger cracks down low and a stellar overhanging, left-slanting hand crack above.# Location
This route is quite far removed from the Willow Springs picnic area. Drive off the asphalt onto the rugged dirt road about a quarter mile until a 2-car pullout appears on the right. Park and hike up the hillside to the base of the route. To descend from the top, hike twenty feet to the climber's left and rap from a tree with one rope.# Protection
Standard rack to #3 Camalot.
