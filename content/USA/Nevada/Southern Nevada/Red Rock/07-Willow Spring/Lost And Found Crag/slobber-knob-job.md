# Description
This one turned out to be my favorite in the area. Solid rock and surprisingly well protected with small gear. Follow the obvious seam till it just about ends then trend to the right and pull up on top of the formation..# Location
Up high on right side of crag.# Protection
Small cams and nuts plus one 3" cam for a pocket up high. A few finger/hand sizes for belay.
