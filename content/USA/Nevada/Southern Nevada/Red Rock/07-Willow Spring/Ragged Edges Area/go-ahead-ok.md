# Description
Fun face climbing up great rock with nice movement.Seems fairly consistant.Probably has been lead/TR'd a bunch but its a fun diversion if you're in the area.# Location
Located on the face between "Go Ahead and Jump" and "Ok Ok Ok".Traverse to anchor tree on Go Ahead and Jump for the git down.# Protection
#3 Camalot in the circular hole is fun for pro.Several other holes and horizontals take cams well enough to make this a saavy lead.Suggest a selection of small to large cams for this lead, single set.
