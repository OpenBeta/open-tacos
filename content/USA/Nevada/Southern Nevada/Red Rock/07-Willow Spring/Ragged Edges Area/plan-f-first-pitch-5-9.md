# Description
To the left of Ragged Edges is this tasty lookin' crack system that ends at the two-bolt anchor of Ragged Edges. This is where the route ends... and is 5.9. Good pro all the way on excellent holds. Hardly any crack climbing until... well, you'll figure it out.The continuation of the original route after the 5.9 crux (without clipping the bolts on Ragged Edge's anchor) moves left through two bolts and some spicy 5.11 climbing.Tick this here route if ya only do the 5.9.# Location
