# Description
An easy low-angle face leads to a short but physical offwidth through a section of black varnish.  The climb then opens up into a large chimney with easy climbing over poor rock; not much pro for this part.  This climb would get more stars if it was all like the bottom section, without the chossy chimney up high.  However, this is still a good route if you want to work on some 5.9 offwidth technique.# Location
The obvious crack in the large left-facing corner to the left of Ragged Edges.  To descend, either rap off a slung tree to the left, or head right to the Ragged Edges walk off.# Protection
Single rack of cams to a #6 Camalot.
