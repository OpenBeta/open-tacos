# Description
Climb fun moves on really quality stone up a black streak. The bolt on this one has been broken off for a looong time-be glad you're not the one that snapped it. Above the bolt, nice climbing with a couple of reaches leads to steep jugs and an anchor crack that takes hand sized pieces.# Location
Starts just left of the boulder that borders the start of Go Ahead and Jump, in perfect black varnish with ASCA 1/2 in bolt 14' up.# Protection
1 bolt at the start, cams and wires above.Â  Communal bolted rap anchor straight above the top out on the back wall.
