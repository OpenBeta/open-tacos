# Description
Go Ahead and Jump is located about 25 yards left, or east, of Kemosabe and five feet right of a large (5 foot tall) white boulder leaning against the crags. Climb the crack located on the black face through a chimney and up to a tree - optional belay and rappel station. Pull through another chimney to a ledge and another tree. Belay here then hike west to the top of Tonto and rappel that route with a 60 meter rope.# Location
