# Description
A short, semi-fun climb that goes right of an overhang. The crux is getting past a slight bulge. The rest of the route is not too exciting.# Location
This route is located on the hillside almost directly above diplomatic immunity. There is an obvious crack that climbs right of an overhang.# Protection
Standard rack protects well. I used a #4 cam at the end for safety measure but I don't think you'll need it. Sling the chockstone at the top to belay and walk off.
