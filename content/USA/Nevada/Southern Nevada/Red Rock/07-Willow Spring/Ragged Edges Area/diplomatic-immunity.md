# Description
Start at an overhanging section using some nice face holds and hand jams.  Climb the crack straight up to the large flat area with a slung tree to the right.  Continue to the left to a large ledge (really just a scramble), or rap from the tree (this significantly shortens the route).  The ledgy area is also the top of Revoked.If you continue the climb from the ledge, scramble back to the slung tree and rap.Keep in mind, the beginning moves are harder than 5.5.# Location
Left-side crack of the pillar that is to the right of Crooked Crack.# Protection
Medium gear for the route and large gear for anchor
