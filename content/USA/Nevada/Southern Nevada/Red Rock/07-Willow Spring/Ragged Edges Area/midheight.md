# Description
Climbs huecos and edges to common finishing ledge as Go Ahead and Jump-belay on ledge and walk right to rappel from common midanchor on aforementioned route. For those curious about the odd name, it comes from the precise point on the climb when you get your first believable gear.# Location
Starts a few feet right of Lethal Weapon (thin RF corner) and ten feet left of the white boulder touching the wall. This section of the wall is half a rope left of Ragged Edges crack and just left of Tonto.# Protection
Sparse. You pull the crux on this one before getting any real gear (the cam just above the start isn't helping anything by then). A fun, challenging lead for those not married to the concept of consistent pro.
