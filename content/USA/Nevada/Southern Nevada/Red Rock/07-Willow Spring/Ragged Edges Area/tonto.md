# Description
30 feet left of Ragged Edges is an obvious finger crack on a low angle face.  It is just to the right of a large arch that curves to the right.  Foot smears at the start turns into foot jams in the crack.  About half way up move out of the crack to the right on the face to jugs at the top.  It gets easier as you go.  Two stars because decent 5.5's are hard to come by at RR.# Location
# Protection
Small to medium pro.  Well protected.  Slung tree at the top to rap down on a single.
