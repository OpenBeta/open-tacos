# Description
Start on the white boulder just left of Go Ahead and Jump.  Climb the face above, starting up the thin seam, finishing up the water streak.  Similar in genre and theme to other climbs in the area.  If anyone (Wendell?) has any info on prior ascents, I'd love to hear it.# Location
Rap from communal bolted anchor climbers left when topping out.# Protection
Not much.  .75 camalot, both blue offset nuts, a tipped out #4 C4 (maybe old #4 or #2 Bro would work better).  Hand size for anchor.
