# Description
Nice crack going up a moderate angled wall. The crack trends right then straight up and then back left. Longer slings will help with rope drag.Descent:After topping out, scramble right and down to a small tree with webbing and rap ring. One single rope rap gets you down.(note -  From the base of the wall, this rap is above a pillar to the right of the route.  The tree is visible from the ground.)A alternate rap can be done from above the route Tonto.# Location
Left side of Ragged Edges area.# Protection
Small to medium gear (I think the largest we used was a #1 Camalot), a few longer slings to manage rope drag through the zig-zag portions.
