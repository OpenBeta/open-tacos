# Description
Climb the crack to a ledge shared with Diplomatic Immunity.  The crack is a bit awkward and doesn't seem to like having people in it.  Plenty of face holds on the left mitigate this.  The difficulty eases the higher you climb.# Location
Right-side crack of the pillar to the right of Crooked Crack.# Protection
Medium gear for the route.  Medium to large gear for the anchor.
