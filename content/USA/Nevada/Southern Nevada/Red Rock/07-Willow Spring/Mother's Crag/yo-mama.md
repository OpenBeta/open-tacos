# Description
The white face right of Motorcycle Mama. Relatively easy face climbing but on sandy white rock with no pro near the crux, which adds to the spicy head factor.I soloed it and would not advise leading it unless you are comfortable soloing 5.7; in which case then just solo it.# Location
# Protection
Not much... hence the X rating.Might be possible to setup as a TR.
