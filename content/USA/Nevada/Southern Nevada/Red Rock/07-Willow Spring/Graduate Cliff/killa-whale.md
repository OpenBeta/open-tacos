# Description
The lower section is easy (5.3) and can be bypassed on the right (class 4). The upper pitch (separately named Money Shark?), kind of it's own gig, has two protection bolts and pro to 4" in 45' of climbing.  Rumored to be about 5.10.# Location
The Graduate cliff# Protection
A rack of singles to 4" is plenty. Offset cams handy. No fixed gear but it would be entirely possible to rap off scrub oaks near the top
