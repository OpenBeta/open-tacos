# Description
Walk to School is the crack about 40 feet to the left of The Graduate, the 5.10 corner on the left side of the face. Follow the crack up about 50 feet to a wide horizontal slot, traverse right along this slot, past many loose boulders, about 25 feet until the next vertical crack. Head up this crack 10 feet to the anchor.The anchor is a natural thread with multiple slings and a couple aluminum rap rings. A rappel with a single 60m gets you to the ground. If you continue right along the horizontal slot another ten feet instead of heading up to the slings, you could make it to the two-bolt anchor on The Graduate. However you'd have to pull an exposed, poorly protected move or two to get there.# Location
