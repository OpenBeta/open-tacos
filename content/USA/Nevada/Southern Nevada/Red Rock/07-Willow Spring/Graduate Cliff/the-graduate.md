# Description
Sitting just above Ragged Edges, the Graduate is probably the second most obvious climb in the area. A huge right facing corner with a beautiful streaked slab to its right and rough white rock to its left, the corner literally begs to be climbed.Belay about 20' below the corner and head up across semi-easy 5th class terrain the base of the corner. Some tricky moves under a small roof lead to the corner proper. Follow the corner until a large roof is reached. From here, step left around the corner and climb up easy terrain to a two-bolt anchor.A single rope rappel will bring you back to the base.# Location
# Protection
Bring at least 2 #3 camalots or equivalent, but 3 would be better. Also bring a big cam for down low. Other than that, a couple of hand sized pieces should suffice.
