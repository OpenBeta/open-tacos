# Description
Begin 10-20 ft to the right of the graduate and make your way up the slab/face to the base of the climb. Begin up the vertical and slightly overhanging face past four bolts. Pull the sugary roof (easy) and traverse left to the anchor at The Graduate. Optionally, you could traverse under the roof with slightly better rock quality.# Location
# Protection
Mastercam 00 and 0 protects at the base of the climb before the first bolt. After the fourth bolt bring 0.4"-1" for underneath the roof. If you traverse under the roof you would need 3"-4"
