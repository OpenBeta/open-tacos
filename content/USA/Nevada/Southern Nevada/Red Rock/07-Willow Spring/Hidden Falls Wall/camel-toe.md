# Description
A straightforward warm-up for the more interesting and challenging Big Foot# Location
Near the top/far right of the large slabby boulder in the corner between the Black Track crack and the tan-colored steep face of Buffalo Balls# Protection
Three bolts to a two-bolt chain anchor.  A couple mediocre gear placements exist to protect stepping off the boulder onto the face.  Feels less run-out than it looks
