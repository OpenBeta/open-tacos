# Description
This is an enjoyable route for those looking for new terrain.  I thought it was fun, even though it gets no stars in the new guidebook.Scramble up easy but loose rock to the base of a A-framed chimney/roof feature.  Plug in some hand sized gear and enjoy the wild moves out of the roof.  Black varnish climbing leads to a short runout before a bolt.  Continue up on somewhat loose rock to the anchors on the 5.8 route to the left or the anchors above Left Out.# Location
This is the first route to the left of Left Out.# Protection
Single set of cams to #3 camalot w/ emphasis on small gear, 2 #2 camalots are helpful for the bomb bay chimney/roof.
