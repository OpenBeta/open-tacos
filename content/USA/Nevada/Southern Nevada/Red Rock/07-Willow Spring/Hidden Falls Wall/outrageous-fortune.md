# Description
It's a good idea to have a long stick clip as the first bolt is about 20 feet off the deck.  Very thin, fingery climbing on high quality, black-varnished sandstone. You can set up a toprope by leading "Left Out", which is a gear route, and dropping your rope down "Outrageous Fortune" with directional draws.# Location
The bolted route in between "Left Out" and "Black Track."# Protection
9 bolts.  Shares anchors with "Left Out."
