# Description
Black Track is the obvious right leaning crack that goes up the middle of Hidden Falls Wall. The climb is well protected but is a bit off-width in places and can be a little clumsy. Otherwise, the climb is an excellent workout on hand and fist crack. When done, rappel the route with one rope. A short second pitch with two bolts on the face (5.11c) has also been done.# Location
# Protection
A few medium to large nuts plus a full rack of cams up to 4 inches
