# Description
Start on a fingertips crack under a large roof on the south side of the formation. Proceed up the crack for about 25 feet and over a wedged block into tight squeeze full body opening that converges into a layback/fist crack running in the corner of the roof (east) for about 20 feet. Using minimally available smears and fists (occasional toe hook) move right under the roof to the edge. At the lip, mount a burly exit to stand up into a barely protected OW. Continue up the offwidth for about 20 feet until able to reach a helpful small handrail on the left. Continue to a large belay ledge.An easy (5.5) chimney leads to the summit. 50 feet.This is a route that where a five or six inch piece would be very well placed for a calmer nervous system.  It is possible to downclimb on the back of formation, either through the narrow break on the right or a ramp sequence further below on the back.# Location
