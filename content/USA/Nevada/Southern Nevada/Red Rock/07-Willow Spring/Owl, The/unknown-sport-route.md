# Description
Ascends the southwest face of the formation. Chill climbing (5.8) to a large ledge where a strange stem allows for clipping the second bolt. Odd, offbalance moves lead through less than inspiring rock for several bolts with a potentially heinous fall from bolt four. Slightly more runout climbing on better rock leads from here to the anchor 40 feet above. Burly and tricky at the same time. If you could have any confidence in the rock at all around bolt four it wouldn't be a bad route.# Location

8 bolts to anchors.
