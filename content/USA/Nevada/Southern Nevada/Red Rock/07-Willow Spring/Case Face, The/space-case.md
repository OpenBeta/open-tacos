# Description
This route is located about 10 feet right of the left side of the Case Face.  Climb a steep section past a bolt (5.7 crux) into a crux. Continue up easier ground following this left-trending crack. Belay at the top of the crack wherever possible. This is a fun, easy trad lead.Descent:A slightly nerve-wracking downclimb is possible. From the belay, traverse left across a slab (scary) to a corner, then downclimb a slab towards the base of the climb. It also appears that some people rap from a small bush on the slab (also looks a little scary). It is also possible to climb an easy 5th class pitch up and then traverse right under the roof to the bolted anchors atop Head Case and rap from here.# Location
