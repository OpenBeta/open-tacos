# Description
Route is just right ofTerritorial Imperativeon the awesome black varnished wall. Climb and easy wide left facing corner (few options for small pro) at 5.5 for 25ft until a step left into a big pocket and clip the next 7 or 8 bolts to a chain anchor. Route anchor is to the right of T.I. but can be reached from T.I. via a small traverse to the right.  Great route, bolted well, and clean rock.# Location
Approach as for Case Face, when close to Case Face take climbers trail left against the rock and follow to base ofTerritorial Imperative(small scramble to get to base). Route lies to the right of T.I.# Protection
7 or 8 bolts + anchor. Small gear if not comfortable soloing up 5.5 to the first bolt.
