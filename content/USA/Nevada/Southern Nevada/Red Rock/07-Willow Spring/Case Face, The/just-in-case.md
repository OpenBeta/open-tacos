# Description
Just in Case is a short, easy climb on the far left side of the Case Face. Climb up to a bolt (5.5 crux), then trend up and left on easy, unprotected face towards a flake. Gear belay at the top of the flake.Descent:A slightly nerve-wracking downclimb is possible. From the belay, traverse left across a slab (scary) to a corner, then downclimb a slab towards the base of the climb. It also appears that some people rap from a small bush on the slab (also looks a little scary). It is also possible to climb an easy 5th class pitch up and then traverse right under the roof to the bolted anchors atopHead Caseand rap from here.# Location
