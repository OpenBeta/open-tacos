# Description
This route is located in the middle of the Case Face and climbs through the white lower half of the cliff up into dark varnish. Mostly good face climbing, protected by nuts and cams in the varnish where possible, bolts where not. The beginning is a little weird, with awkward moves to get to the first bolt. Since the protection looked pretty marginal from the ground, we toproped this climb by first climbingSpace Case, then doing a second pitch up and right to get to the Head Case anchors. Once we got on the face, protection opportunities were more obvious.# Location
# Protection
Several bolts and small to medium gear.
