# Description
This is a gem that never gets done. The crux is getting to the 2nd bolt. The two bolts are a bit suspect looking rusty. You can protect the moves to the 2nd bolt by placing pro in the small seam to the right. Looks harder than it is. More of a head problem. Natural gear belay at top of crack\flake. (A rap anchor here would be a great idea) 2nd pitch very short slab moves. 5.6# Location
On black water streak left of Case Face. (Pg. 248 J. Handren Guide Book)Walk off climbers right down gully in gully left of Case Face (5th class) or Right of Case Face (easier terrain)# Protection
Pro to 3"2 bolts. (Need to be replaced)Build your own anchor. (Camolots # 1, 2, and 3)
