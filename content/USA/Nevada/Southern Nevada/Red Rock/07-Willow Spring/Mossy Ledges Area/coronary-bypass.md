# Description
A pleasant route.  This could probably be done in a single pitch if you scramble up a bit to establish your initial belay.  But two pitches works out well and reduces rope drag.Climb up and right to a belay stance beneath the right edge of the hanging block.  Climb past a small overhang and continue up the varnished face to the big ledge.  A bolted rap station is on the right side of this ledge.# Location
Start at the left base of the Hanging Block Buttress.# Protection
