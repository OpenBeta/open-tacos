# Description
High up, on the third tier of cliffs, there is a gem of a jam crack, similar in character and quality toRagged Edges.  The cheatstone itself is a boulder about the size of a fairly roomy utility shed.  A few stems simplify the opening moves.  Good hand jams lead up the steep, pocketed face to a small alcove with a wide crack.  Stem to the top and walk off left.# Location
Because this route is high up, on the third tier of cliffs, the obvious approach is to climb one of the routes (e.g.Numic WarriororPincushion) that end at this level, and walk left to the start of the crack.  Alternatively, climb the slab above the top ofSoylent Green Jeans(easy fourth or fifth class) and scramble right to the route.# Protection
