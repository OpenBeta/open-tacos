# Description
This route is a pleasant top-rope pitch.  To lead it would require long run-outs (or a Hundred-Foot Stick Clip!).Climb the headwall beneath the slab, then wander up the lower-angled rock above.  Near the top, you will pass an old protection bolt; a short distance above there is a two-bolt belay/rappel station.# Location
Just to the right of the alcove withStirling Mossis a buttress with a slab on its left side. Scramble up to the base of the steep, varnished headwall beneath the slab.# Protection
