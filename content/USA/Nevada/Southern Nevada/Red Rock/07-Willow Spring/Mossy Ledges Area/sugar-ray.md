# Description
The obvious crack parallel to Roberto Duran (you know, the route I thought I was on).  3 dimensional climbing leads up the crack, using many face holds, some jams, and a bit of stemming.  All of this leads to a final crux section before pulling up onto the ledge.  We slung the block above the scrub oak as our anchor.   Rap off 100 foot Stick Clip.Surely some one has done this route.  Just posting a name to hasten it's correction.# Location
Scramble up to Soylent Green Jeans, then walk right to the corner.  Same spot as Roberto Duran.# Protection
SR to 3 or 4"
