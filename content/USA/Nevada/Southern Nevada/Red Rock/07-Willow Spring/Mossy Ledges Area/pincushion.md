# Description
This is a good quality line that goes up to the top of the second tier of cliffs.  A bunch of old pitons found in this corner indicate that this route has some history to it.Climb a white crack to a right-facing dihedral capped by a roof with an offwidth crack.  Continue up the wide crack to a large ledge.  (This pitch is not really up to the quality of the climbing above; a more aesthetic start might be to climbChocolate Sundayto reach the big ledge.)At the far right end of the large ledge, climb the corner system and belay in a small alcove with some fixed pins.  The next pitch continues up the crack, past a small roof, a short offwidth, and a few more fixed pitons.  Eventually climb a featured chimney to the top.Descend by walking left (east) to a wide broken area.  On the eastern edge of the broken area, a rappel from a pine tree leads down a featured slab to the ledges above Soylent Green Jeans.  There is a rappel tree here also, but it is easier to scramble (skier's right) down a short 4th class section, coming out at the big pine tree beneathSoylent Green Jeans.# Location
Begin on the right edge of the Hanging Block Buttress, immediately to the left of a large pine tree.# Protection
