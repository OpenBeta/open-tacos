# Description
This is a delightfully improbable route.  Though it looks like it might be hard and unprotected, it turns out to be quite reasonable.Just right of the start ofHundred-Foot Stick Clip, climb a steep, varnished flake.  Continue up, staying just right of a blunt arete, until you reach the left end of a large roof.  After a few moves, you can step left to the bolted belay/rappel station onHundred-Foot Stick Clip.# Location
Climb up to the ledges at the start of Coronary Bypass to a short flake just to the right of the dark headwall.# Protection
