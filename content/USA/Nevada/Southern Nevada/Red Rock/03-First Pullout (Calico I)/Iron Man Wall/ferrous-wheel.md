# Description
Th is route ascends the far right side of the wall. Straightforward 5.6 slab climbing brings you to a break under a roof, where tricky technical moves on round crimpers pull you up onto the upper section of the wall. Easier if you're tall. If it were longer and more sustained, it'd be sweet.# Location

Bolts to chains.
