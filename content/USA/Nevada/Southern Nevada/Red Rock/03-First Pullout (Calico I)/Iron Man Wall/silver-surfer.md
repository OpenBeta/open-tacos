# Description
Climbs the face on the right side of the slabby part of the wall. Start under a small roof. Make an awkward and powerful pull off the ground (crux) and around the right side of the roof to the first bolt, and then continue straight up the slab to a vertical section 2/3 the way up the wall. Varnish crimping brings you to the anchors. Probably 5.9 after the first bolt.# Location
# Protection
Bolts to chains.
