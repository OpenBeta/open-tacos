# Description
This crack is visible from the road.  I was hoping it started with more hand crack moves than it does, but you can stem left very quickly.Start in the overhanging hand crack.  Pull over the lip and into the 6" offwidth.  If you neglected to bring a #6 cam, clip the bolt on Particle Man with a long runner.  Swim up the crack, reaching a nice ledge 6' left of Oxosis' anchor.Build an anchor with .5-1 camalots, or utilize the bolted anchor.# Location
Obvious fat crack between Particle Man and Oxosis.# Protection
Single rack .5-3, optional #6.
