# Description
This climb sits to the right and behind the Iron Man Wall, near the left edge of the Ultraman. The left hand bolted line, this climb follows the old KP addage: "the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, but the easiest path wanders". You'll be wandering a bit on this one. Head up the obvious crack/break to where it goes horizontal, traverse left, and weave your way up the slab above. Bail right around the final vertical section, and clip those chains. A little cruxy off the ground.# Location
