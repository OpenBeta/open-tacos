# Description
This is a short little route up an attractive, overhanging triangular boulder near the Great Red Roof. It is the lefthand of two bolted lines and follows a vague, obtuse corner. The crux is the final move or two, including a deadpoint or long reach to the last hold - if you can find it! It is possible to top out and walk off the back.Use caution making clips - the rock is a bit hollow in spots and an attentive belay will go a long way towards keeping this experience safe. We found a long sling on the last bolt makes clipping more reasonable.# Location
Mini Me is the lefthand bolted line on the overhanging, triangular boulder that is about 50 yards up and left from, and facing, the Great Red Roof.# Protection
4x bolts to a bolted anchor.
