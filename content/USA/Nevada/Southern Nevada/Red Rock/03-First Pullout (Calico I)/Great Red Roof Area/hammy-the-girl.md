# Description
Start atop a boulder and hand traverse a rail to the right until it makes sense to start moving up and left-ish. This route is really fun, with a nice variety of movement in its meager height. It serves as a good warm up for the Great Red Roof.# Location
Approach as for the Great Red Roof. Once under the roof, follow the gully to its left uphill for about 40ft. Skirt left of a 20ft. tall boulder. Climb a 4ft. rock section on the left (west) of the boulder. Now follow a ramp downhill and to the northwest, into the shade, passing a fist crack on the wall to the left. You'll see bolts on the shady north facing wall, 20 ft. past the fist crack.# Protection
8 quick draws. 6Â for the route and 2 for the anchor. Stick clip.
