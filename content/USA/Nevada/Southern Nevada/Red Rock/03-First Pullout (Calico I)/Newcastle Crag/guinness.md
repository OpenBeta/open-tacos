# Description
Good route...almost as good as the Beer.Just left of Full Sail.The crux is in the first 3 bolts.  It looks a little chossy in that area too...but it's all good.  The distance between the 4th and 5th bolt does not appear to create any groundfall potential...but could make for a fun whipper.  The climbing above the 4th bolt is easy (5.9?), but there is a 15-20 foot run to the chains to keep things fun (5.6ish for this portion).# Location
This is the third route from the left.  Second from the right. Full Sail is the far right route.# Protection
