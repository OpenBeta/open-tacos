# Description
Interesting choppy crack with enjoyable stem and lie-back maneuvers.  Quite short, but full of an abundance of formations that allow any beginner with will-power to scramble up it with a smile.  Feels easier if you have crack climbing experience.# Location
Anchor is accessible by scrambling up the east side of the formation and walking to the obvious crack, but if it's your first time there you may want to be on belay while you creep down to the small shelf to set up the TR.# Protection
Two bolts at the top.  TR only.
