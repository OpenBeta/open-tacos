# Description
Splitter at a sport crag. Reminiscent of Yin+Yang but thinner, more smearing, and much smaller pro. A good excuse to visit Civilization Crags and the best rock on the cliff. Not much real crack climbing on this one, more of a V3/4 boulder problem with good gear, but it's an exciting line that will reward those that are adept at placing pro quickly from smears. Worthwhile.# Location
The arching thin splitter above an offwidth flare sandwiched betweenBabylon 5.8andConquistadoron the right side of the main wall. Shares anchor with Conquistador.# Protection
Cams tiny to #4, exact beta would kinda ruin the fun. Bringing 2 #00 TCUs is a good idea, I used a #9 nut but it's very optional. No long slings or trickery, just a few cams added to your sport kit.
