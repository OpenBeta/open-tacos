# Description
Fun little route that follows up the back side of Civilization.  Can face climb with ample protectability, or slot yourself into a series of three chimney/small hands cracks.  Not worth a hike in for, but if in the area and itching for a lil crack action, may be worth hitting up.  Definitely must have been others who have done it before, but adding it because it's such a perfect moderate route with already placed chains for easy rap.NOTE*  This route needs quite a bit of TLC and cleaning.  Lots of fragile rock, be careful and mindful of rock quality for protection.# Location
From civilization wall, walk around right of the prominent arÃªte.  Follow the first moderate crack on the left that starts in a small chimney or follow up the cruiser seam on the slab on the right to enter the crack above the chimney.# Protection
Standard rack to #4 C4.  End at a juicy belay ledge that eats up small cams for anchor.  The belay ledge sits directly above Conquistador, so can easily rap off of those rings which are within arms reach from belay ledge.
