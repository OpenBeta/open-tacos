# Description
The crux of this climb is probably the approach where there is an obvious, slanted chimney that goes up to a ledge with a very sappy tree. Then you would continue up some chossy stuff until you reach the anchors. The route is often used as an approuch to the Oasis.# Location
Just above and left of the tree above the chimeney and leads to the Oasis.# Protection
Standard rack 2"
