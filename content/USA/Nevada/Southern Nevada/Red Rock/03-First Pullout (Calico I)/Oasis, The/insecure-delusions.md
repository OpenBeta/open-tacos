# Description
A few hard crimp moves in the middle of the route and a fairly difficult clip off an insecure fingerlock and this one is over. Make sure your belayer is paying attention on this clip. If you come off with the rope in your hand you could hit the ledge behind you. The varnished edges at the top look like they could break at any time. Its probably not a good idea to climb this one if it's at all wet.# Location
The right hand route on the upper tier.# Protection
