# Description
The rock down low on this one is a bit suspect looking but seemed solid enough. Hard overhanging crimps and dynos will get you to a difficult clip on the 4th bolt. Then if you're short you will have one more strenous long move to pull over the bulge to easier ground. This move may be easier if you are over 6' as you will be able to reach past the last crux move.# Location
The third route on the right hand wall.# Protection
