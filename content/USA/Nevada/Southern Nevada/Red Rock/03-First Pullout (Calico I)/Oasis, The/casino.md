# Description
Probably the best route on the cliff. Overhanging crimps will get you to the pumpy finish. Watch for a bit of rotten rock right before the first clip.# Location
The second route in on the left wall. It used to be the first bolted route but Mark Limage just added a 5.8 warmup to the left of Casino.# Protection
5 bolts
