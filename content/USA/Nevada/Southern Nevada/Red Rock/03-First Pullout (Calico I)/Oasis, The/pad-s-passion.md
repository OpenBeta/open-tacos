# Description
Lean across the belay pad and clip the first bolt. Better yet, bring a stick clip so you don't risk taking a 20 footer into a jumble of rocks!  After the clip, step over and pull a couple of 5.8 moves, then slab to the anchors.# Location
Located just to left of Sands on the right side of the Oasis.# Protection
