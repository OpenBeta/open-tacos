# Description
Arguably the best route on the cliff. A very enjoyable climb with good protection the whole way up. A great route for any one looking to break into harder traditional climbing. The route has the occasional hand jams, finger locks, and many face holds to keep you guessing. The steepness of the climb at the top will pump you out if you hesitate to long, so place that 0 TCU (Saved by Zero) and go for it.# Location
This route is the obvious finger crack up the left side of the cliff that gets steeper at the top.# Protection
SR to 2", TCU's, and a couple of larger pieces for the  gear anchor at the top.
