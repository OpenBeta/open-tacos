# Description
This route is the thin seam to the right and up from Fixx cliff.  We happened upon this climb after doing a 5.8 on Dog wall.  When we came toward the climb, about 20 Gambel's Quail flew off.  The seam offers a little marginal protection down low.  The real crux of this climb is trusting the rock.  On the FA, we probably broke 10 holds- I took a ground fall after breaking 3 holds 5 feet up.  There is about 20 feet of near vertical 5.7 climbing followed by 60 feet of 4th class/ 5.0 climbing.# Location
Above Dog wall, right of Fixx cliff.  This is the thin seam 15' left of a large crack# Protection
