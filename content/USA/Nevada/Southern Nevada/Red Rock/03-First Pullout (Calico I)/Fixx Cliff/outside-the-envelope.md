# Description
Short route up seam and edges to slab, a little harder and a little longer than "the Bindle" to its right-on this one, the gear might make you feel better, but given the quality of the pro down low, a spot until close to the lip might be more realistic. Gear anchor, walk off right.# Location
2nd from right on the Fixx Cliff# Protection
Small to medium
