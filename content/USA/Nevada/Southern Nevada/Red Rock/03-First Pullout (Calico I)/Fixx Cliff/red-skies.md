# Description
This one deserves a PG or R rating. The first bolt is about 30' up and the only gear up to that point is a #1 HB and a .5 Camalot in a shallow flared crack. The climbing through this section is delicate and sustained. I'm not real confident that either one of the gear placements would hold a fall. If you make it to the first bolt your safe and can now enjoy the sustained and very pumpy overhanging face to the top. If the gear was better on the bottom half this would be a classic comparable to Saved by Zero.# Location
Just to the right of Saved by Zero.# Protection
#1 HB, .5 Camalot, 3 bolts and maybe a couple of small cams for the top slabs. #.5, .2 or .3 & #2 camalots for the anchor.
