# Description
A rather sporty route. A #1 and #2 camalot will fit into the horizontal about 15 feet up. Run it out to the bolt. Don't come off as your belayer will have a tough time keeping you off the ground if you do. The crux comes right past the bolt. Be careful of loose rock on the top slabby section.# Location
Just to the left of Crack is a huecoed face with a bolt about 20-25 feet up.# Protection
small cams will get you up the crack past the bolt to an alcove. 1-3" cams for the anchor.
