# Description
This climb is worth doing on a visit to Fixx Cliff after you have done the classic Saved by Zero. The crux is the first 15 feet of the climb and involves finger locks, a sloper, and a good incut. Punch through this section to easier terrain to the top. Guide books I have looked at have this rated the same as Saved by Zero. I think the moves at the crux are harder than any of the crux moves on Saved by Zero, but the short length of the crux evens it out making this climb less sustained.# Location
Locate Saved by Zero and Crack is the clean finger crack to the left that after 15 feet the angle of the climb eases off.# Protection
Small stoppers, TCU's, .4 Camalot,.75 Camalot, and a couple hand sized pieces for the gear anchor at the top.
