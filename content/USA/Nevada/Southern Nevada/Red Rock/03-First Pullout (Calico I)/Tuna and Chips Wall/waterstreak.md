# Description
This climb is a fun climb, but is a sandbag unless you wander around to find holds. The name implies and fulfills itself in this relatively water-polished line. While in the book as 2 pitches, with a fixed belay above the 'pillar' or just run all the way up in a single 70M pitch.In the center of the Tuna and Chips wall there is a small tower with a crack/groove on each side. 'Tuna Cookies' is on the left and 'Waterstreak' is on the right. Walk up the right side to a darker, rounded chute and start climbing Waterstreak.Climb up and past a few bolts- these are a distance apart, and the climbing between a little unobvious and insecure. Best to be on your game on this route. Continue up (getting easier now) eventually reaching the top of the pillar and the groove above it. Belay here at the anchor or continue climbing up the groove as for Tuna Cookies. The relatively easy moves to reach the summit of the right side of the Tuna and Chips Wall will be welcome with the runout.Belay up top and then to walk off, go back and to the right and scramble down (5.0).Like Tuna and Chips, this is a fun line and will provide good climbing for a party competent to lead it.# Location
