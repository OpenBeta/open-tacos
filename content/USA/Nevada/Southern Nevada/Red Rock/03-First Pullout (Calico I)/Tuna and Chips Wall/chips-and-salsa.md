# Description
What can I say?  At 5.3 most will think this trivial and in fact it is well suited for a solo, date climb or neophyte first lead.  But as 5.3 routes go, it really is a pretty nice climb.Locate the prominent cleft that that bisects the Tuna and Chips Wall.  Tuna & Chips goes up the left side of the wall and Tuna Cookies the right.  Chips and Salsa starts behind a large block at the bottom of the cleft at a low angle crack.  Waterstreak goes up the obvious polished feature to the right.  Face climb up the nicely featured rock along the crack to a belay where it opens into a wide chimney.  There is a bolt and drilled angle for an anchor, as Waterstreak joins here as well.  Wander up easier - and certainly less exposed - climbing in the chimney to the top. This is mostly scrambling and not much actual chimney technique is necessary.  Descend to the climbers right and down a gully.# Location
