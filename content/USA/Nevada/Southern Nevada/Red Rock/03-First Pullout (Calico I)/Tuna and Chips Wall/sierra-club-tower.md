# Description
The Sierra Club Tower is the short tower found on the left-hand side of the Tuna and Chips wall.  This route has been led, but is better as a top-rope problem.  The gear is a bit thin.There is a two-bolt anchor on top of the tower.  These bolts are very close to the edge and require an individual to girth-hitch runners into the bolts in order to safely build an anchor.  Carabiners clipped to these bolts would hang precariously over the edge.The top of the tower is easily accessed via the ramp to the left.There are a number of lines on this short tower.  They range in difficulty from 5.6 to 5.8 depending on the variation.# Location
