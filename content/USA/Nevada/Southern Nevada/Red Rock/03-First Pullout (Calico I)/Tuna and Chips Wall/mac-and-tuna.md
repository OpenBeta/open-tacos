A good warm-up for the area while staying consistent with the minimal bolting theme. Â Big holds on solid varnish get you to a high first bolt at about 25ft. Two more bolts over the next 50ft. lead to a chain anchor.# Location
Located between Water Streak and Tuna Cookies# Protection
3 bolts to chains
