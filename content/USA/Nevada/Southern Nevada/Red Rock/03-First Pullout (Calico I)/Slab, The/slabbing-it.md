# Description
"Slabing It" is the first route on the very left end of the wall.  There are 14 bolted routes to the right of this one.  This route is well protected with 8 bolts that lead pretty much straight up the wall to a two chain anchor.  There are optional starts to this route, the crux being the lower half of the climb and then it gets very easy from there.  Be aware the upper portion has some hollow flakes that can eaisly break if used for holds.  Helmets are reccomended for both belayer and climber on this route as well all other routes on this wall.# Location
This route is at the very left end of the wall and begins directly under the first set of chains that are visible. One can rappel or lower from the quick links.# Protection
Eight bolts lead straight up the wall to a two chain anchor with quick links.
