# Description
This route starts directly under the obvious water streak at the far right side of the wall. The water polished rock looks and feels glass smooth in places.  There are options for getting up the lower portion on not much more than little nubbins for holds. This steeper bottom section, the crux, gets much milder from about the mid point to the anchor.# Location
This is the first route at the far right side of the wall, directly under the water streak. The route goes straight up the streak and then drifts off to the right to the anchor. If you find yourself in or around theTuna and Chips Wall, you have gone too far.# Protection
Six bolts lead to a two chain anchor with quick links.
