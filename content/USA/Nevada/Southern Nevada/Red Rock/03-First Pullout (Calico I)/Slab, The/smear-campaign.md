# Description
This is a easy slab climb. One move wonder is more like it. The crux on this climb is right after the first bolt. The climb is very well protected. Follow 5 bolts to the chains at the top. A quick and easy tick.# Location
This route (the only route originally bolted) is the 2nd route from the right about 10ft right ofSlab Happyand about 15ft left around the bushes from the water streak. It goes up and slightly to the left to the anchor.# Protection
Five bolts lead to a two chain anchor with quick links.
