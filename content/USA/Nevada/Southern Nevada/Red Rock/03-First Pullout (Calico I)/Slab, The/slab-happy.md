# Description
Start about 8ft to the right ofSlab Stick, just left of a little dark scoop. After a few harder moves near the bottom, the route gets easier approaching the anchor. The low crux is a bit height dependent. Like the other climbs at this wall, watch for thin flexing flakes.# Location
This is the 3rd route from the right and is under the 3rd set of chains to the right of the only set of chains on the upper portion of the wall. It is about 8ft to the right ofSlab Stickand 12ft to the left ofSmear Campaign. The anchor is shared with the two routes to the left.# Protection
Five bolts lead to a two chain anchor with quick links.
