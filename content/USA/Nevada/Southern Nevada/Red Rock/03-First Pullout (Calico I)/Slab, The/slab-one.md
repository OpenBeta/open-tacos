# Description
This route was originally one of three top rope only routes by Mark Limage and Jake Burkey that have now been bolted. Start about 12ft right ofSlab-A-Dab-A-Doo. Climb left then go straight up the slab to a two chain anchor above the break.With better rock quality than some of its neighbors, this is a solid beginner route.# Location
This route is in the center of the wall, the 8th from the left and also the 8th from the right. It can be located by finding the only set of chain anchors which are on the upper portion of the wall and about 5 or 6 feet higher than all the others. This route is about 12ft right ofSlab-A-Dab-A-Dooand 8ft left ofSlab Line.# Protection
Five bolts lead to a two chain anchor with quick links.
