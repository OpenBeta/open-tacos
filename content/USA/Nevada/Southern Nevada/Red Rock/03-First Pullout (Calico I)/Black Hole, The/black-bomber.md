# Description
Awesome climbing on this one-my favorite on the cliff. Mixture of bolts and gear, put it in when you can get it. Starts on varnish in the black hole right of and above the sport route. Contrary to the description in the Brock/McMillen book, there are cold shut anchors up there, but you may need a long or second rope for the rap-it's a distance.# Location
Starts 20 feet right of the Unknown Sport Route.# Protection
Standard and 5 bolts.
