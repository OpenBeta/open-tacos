# Description
Fun little 4 bolt sport climb, up on the higher right side of the cliff. Bolt anchor in place, it's a bit of a scramble up the chimney or around the face to get to this one from the other routes, but worth it-a nice route.# Location
Upper right side of the Black Hole cliff.# Protection
4 bolts
