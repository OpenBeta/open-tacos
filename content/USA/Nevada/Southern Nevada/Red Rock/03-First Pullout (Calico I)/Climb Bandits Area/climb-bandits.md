# Description
This is a great looking crack that angles up and right; hits a small pod with two large blocks; follows a hand crack vertically to a bulge where you traverse left about 8 feet and follow another hand crack to the top of the formation.  WARNING; I have not finished this climb, the right angling crack down low takes great pro around 1", but the two large blocks at the pod are VERY rotten rock and will NOT take gear.  I tried to get a cam up higher into another solid crack but had my pro blow out of the rotten rock first and decked before I could get the good piece clipped.  The sides of the block are very rotten and I watched them literally flex about 3 inches before my cam popped.  Be very careful if trying to protect this route on lead as that section is bad.  See the photos# Location
You can't miss the route on the block in the middle of the gully.  It's the obvious right angling crack; the walk off would be very easy off the back and down the gully on the west side of the wall.# Protection
No bolts; all traditional protection ranging from small cams and nuts to around 3".  No fixed gear and no anchors on top either.
