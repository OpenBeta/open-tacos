# Description
Direct start to Killer Joe. Stick clip the 2nd bolt on Killer Joe, and start on a crimp rail in the otherwise-blank, dark face. Long moves on mostly good edges and sidepulls with awkward feet culminate in a tough move up to the clipping holds of the 2nd bolt of Killer Joe. Finish as for Killer Joe with easier climbing to a runout slab.Grade is a rough guess ~ boulder felt about V4, reach is useful. This one was much more enjoyable than the similarly bouldery route to its left, with a tricky and sustained entry sequence.# Location
Left of Killer Joe, skipping the first bolt.# Protection
4 bolts to chain anchor. Pre-clip the second bolt on Killer Joe.
