# Description
The furthest right line on the main wall. Dyno (or don't) to the first flat jug and pull up into a juggy, sandy flake. Fight straight up and over to some pretty good crimps, and deal with one thin move before pulling into the pod and a no hands rest. More steepness on pretty good holds takes you up and left and into the finish of Celestial Spheres. Good fun.# Location
# Protection
Seven bolts to chains.
