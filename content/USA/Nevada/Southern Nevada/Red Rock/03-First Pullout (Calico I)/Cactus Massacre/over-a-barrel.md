# Description
This climb starts on the obvious large Heucos on a small blunt arete right of "Cactus Head". A few steep and pumpy moves lead to a shallow corner, then straight up a headwall, (the lower crux), which sets you up for a nice seated rest on the sloping ledge above. The rest may be needed to tackle the large over-hang above that guards the anchors.Climb up off the ledge on large unique left-downward slanting \sloping edges to the roof. Climb up and slightly right, easier, (go left for big holds, steeper hero fun) then hand traverse back left for 8-10' on good holds and one final move to the anchors.# Location
This climb start 10' right of the obvious zigzag trad crack, "Cactus Head".# Protection
