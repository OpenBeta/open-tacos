# Description
Like its neighbor to the right, this route has a really fun, slightly technical start, with interesting climbing up to, (and beyond) the definitive crux just above mid-height on the route.# Location
This route starts approx. 15' left of "Never kiss a Cactus".Start on the series of flakes and edges in a slightly shallow corner. Climb up and slightly right thru a shallow slot in an overlap, to a slab and the headwall, (crux), continue up and slightly left to anchors.# Protection
