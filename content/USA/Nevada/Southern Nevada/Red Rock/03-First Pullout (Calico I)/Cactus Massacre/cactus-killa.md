# Description
This route is fun from the start to the finish. Start on the crack in middle of the crag, gain holds on the steep face on the right. climb up through a technical crux, (1st - 2nd bolts). jugs lead up the ever steepening wall to the roof, good holds lead you up and left, then back right to the anchors.# Location
The route starts in the middle of the crag, on the obvious wide, left angling crack at the base of the wall. 20' right of "bbCactus Root".# Protection
