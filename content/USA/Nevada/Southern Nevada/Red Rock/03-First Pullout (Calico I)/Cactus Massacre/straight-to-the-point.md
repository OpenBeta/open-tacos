# Description
Just like the name says, this route wastes no time getting to it! Climb the side by side, steep seams in the dark rock on good jugs, pinches, and edges to a steep face. Continue up the seams on super fun moderate steep face\slab to a 5.8 overlap\roof. Once over come, a fun romp up 30' feet of easy slab.# Location
The route starts just left of the light colored, steep, center wall. It is the 1st route in the dark rock, (it has glue ins) left of the steep light colored wall.# Protection
