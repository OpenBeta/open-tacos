# Description
Climbs through the steep huecos on the right side of the wall to a seam of great rock. The seam brings you to a couple of crimps at the top of the bulge, and a couple more moves gains a cool diagonal dike of varnish. Use this to traverse right and gain the anchors. Pumpy. Really great route.. will be a very popular climb!# Location

Six bolts to chains.
