# Description
This is a serious route. The gear is not very good starting over the bulge, and likely wouldn't hold a fall. Climb up into a solid flake under and sandy white shelf, then follow the steep seam until it makes sense to traverse to Haunted's anchor (or top it out and build your own.. can be walked off with a little downclimbing).# Location
# Protection
Single rack to 1", double .3, .4 camalots or equivalent.
