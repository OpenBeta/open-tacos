# Description
Crux is near the top when the crack ends, getting over the bulge to the anchor.# Location
Right route, starts with a crack on the right and a flake on the left.# Protection
New: crux has a bolt so go for it! First 4/5ths of the route trad to 1". I used yellow, orange and red Metolius plus a few small-med stoppers. Hooks anchor.
