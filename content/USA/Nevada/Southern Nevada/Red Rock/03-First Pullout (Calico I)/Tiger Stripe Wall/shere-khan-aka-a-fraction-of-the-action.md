# Description
This route is excellent, and there is normally no one on it.  This route is located on the road side of the cliff on the right side, about 25ft left of the wide crack.The hard parts are well protected, but the easier climbing is runout.  Start with a cruxy headwall, and then climb the tiger striped slab to a black varnished roof.  Pull the moderate roof and run it out on easy varish to the anchors. Rap with two ropes. A little bit of everything...# Location
# Protection
8 bolts, anchors
