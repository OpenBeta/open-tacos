# Description
On the backside of Tiger Stripe Wall is a fun little  arete; toprope to witness what truly bad bolts look like. Climbs pretty much how it looks; a low-quality  outing.# Location
Walk right from Bengal towards the Fixx Cliff; this arete looks worse the closer you get.# Protection
Ghetto bolt and little else. Reccommended as a toprope only; chossy gear anchor.
