# Description
This route is the leftmost on the Tiger Stripe wall and climbs a white, pink-dotted face past bolts to cold shuts. The rock is pretty soft and the quality so-so, but it's a nice quick route to round out the day with if you're doing Shere Khan.# Location
Far left of cliff, starts in a shady slot.# Protection
4 bolts - "mixed"
