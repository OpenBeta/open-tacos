# Description
This route is a lot of fun, and similar to Tortuga Tower, though clearly not as clean.  Navigate the choss on large holds to a bouldery crux.  Large, dynamic movement gets you to the last bolt, and then an easy 5.8 runout on crispy rock gets you to the chains.(I did not bolt this route and just threw a name on it until the real FA info is found)# Location
15' right of Tortuga Tower and the chimney.# Protection
5 bolts to chain anchor.
