# Description
Easy climbing gets you to large huecos and the last bolt. Â Committing to the final moves is the crux, as you will be forced to use smaller holds on steep terrain.(I did not bolt this route, and will change the name when the real FA info is found)# Location
Left of Turtle Track by 10'.# Protection
Bolts to chain anchor.
