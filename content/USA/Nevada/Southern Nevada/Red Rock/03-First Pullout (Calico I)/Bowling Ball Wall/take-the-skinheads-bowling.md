# Description
A fun, rarely done route with a sweet name. The name is taken from a Camper Van Beethoven song that briefly had a video on MTV in the late 80s. Find the song on the album Telephone Free Landslide Victory. More proof that Paul has good taste in music and an eye for overlooked routes. The crux for most seems to be the bouldery start featuring "bowling ball" pockets.# Location
