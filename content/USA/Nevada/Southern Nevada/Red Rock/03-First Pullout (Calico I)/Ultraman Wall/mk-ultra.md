# Description
A fun face climb that has varied climbing and several cruxy spots. Unexpected techniques for the angle get you through the closely bolted crux, then long stretches of easier climbing between bolts leads to a decent stance and anchor. Sort of like a 5.9 version of Godzilla. Though there is distance between bolts, it worked out nicely that all the stout moves are reasonably short distances above a clip.# Location
Start fifteen feet downhill from Ultraman, diagonal up and right to the first bolt. A 70 meter rope is just barely good for top roping, watch your rope ends.# Protection
Two aliens to get to the first bolt (green and blue), then six bolts to the top.
