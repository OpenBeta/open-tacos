# Description
Right of Scent of an Ultraman, a TR exists that looks like it's been there for a long time, judging from the rust on the quicklinks that are in place. Moderate climbing, probably best set up as a TR after leading Scent or Mothra.# Location
Between Scent of an Ultraman and Mothra, left side of wall.# Protection
Looks like a no pro deal, pretty clearly a toprope and not a lead route. Would be a decent solo if not for an insecure move right at the top and no direct topout to the smiley ledge that makes sense.
