# Description
If you enjoy the climbing on Godzilla and feel like you're having a Bachar day, this lead is for you. Rock is mostly solid though less trafficked than its neighbors, bolted anchor at the top, a fun route with a mind control component. Gear should be considered ornamental, no solid cracks on this one, or horizontals, for that matter.# Location
Right side of Ultraman wall between Destroy All Monsters and Science Patrol-climb where you feel like, don't miss the occasional pro in the varnish.# Protection
Not much-bring wires, tcus, and skinny slings for the plates-you won't be needing much more. Don't expect the stuff you put in to catch you.
