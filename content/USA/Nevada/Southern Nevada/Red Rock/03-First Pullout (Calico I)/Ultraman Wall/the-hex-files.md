# Description
This is the only route on the wall that requires a rack to climb. However, the protection is tricky in spots and non-existent in others. A massive traverse requires many long slings- and rope drag is still an issue!Start in the large left facing dihedral on the right side of the wall. Follow this up as it arches and traverse to the base of a finger crack. Follow this up, then step left and climb over some boulders to a ledge and belay. Just below this ledge is the Science Patrol rappel anchor.Two ropes are required for rappel.# Location
# Protection
Gear to a 3-4" cam is useful, although those looking for more adventure should go for a passive only ascent!
