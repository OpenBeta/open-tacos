# Description
This is the last bolted line on the right hand side of the wall. It starts about 50'-60' to the left of a large, left facing dihedral on black varnish plates.Head up the face, following the bolts through a fun slab section up to a steep headwall. From there, head straight up again to a ledge with two bolts.This is probably the best protected route on the wall, and also one of the best- classic movement on good rock for 170+ feet!You need two ropes to rappel this route.# Location
# Protection
9 bolts.
