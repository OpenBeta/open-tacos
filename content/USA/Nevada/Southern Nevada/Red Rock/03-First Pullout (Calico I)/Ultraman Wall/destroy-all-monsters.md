# Description
A fun line, technical and thin down low, airy and mellow as the route goes on. Name inspired by the 1968 film in which all the Godzilla-era monsters become controlled by an all-female alien race and destroy major cities before battling each other. A safe line and the most technically difficult on the wall, this was a ground-up line bolted onsight on a cloudy winter day and put up with the intent to show that quality sport lines can be put up in good style and still be an adventure to establish.# Location
Between Godzilla and Rodan, start is easy to find since it's a red, smooth, blank-looking corner with a low red bolt. Rappel and TR with an 80 meter rope or use two ropes.# Protection
All bolts on this one, and the only climb on the wall that could really be considered a sport climb. Distances between bolts are more in keeping with standard Red Rock canyon routes than the brain-melting fare close by on the older Ultraman lines. Ground fall would be near-impossible once the first bolt is clipped, though an attentive spot is a good idea since the start feels bouldery. The safest route on the wall, all told. 10 red camoed bolts to anchor.
