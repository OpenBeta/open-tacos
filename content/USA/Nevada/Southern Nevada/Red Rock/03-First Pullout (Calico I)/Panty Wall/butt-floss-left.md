# Description
Find the route Butt Floss (TR) as listed on this site- just to the left is a TR line that is independent and of independent character. If you were going to bother with a TR for the 7m of climbing on Butt Floss, you may as well double your mileage by climbing to the left of it as well. This crackless face is harder and more sustained. Maybe 11- or 10+.Walk off right and down a ramp to the base again, or walk to the left and scramble down the little gully.# Location
# Protection
This route is listed as a TR and seems to be done most commonly that way.  It is a little taller than the nearby 'Thong' (which I refer to as a boulder problem) and the crux is mid-route. Perhaps a TR this is for that reason.
