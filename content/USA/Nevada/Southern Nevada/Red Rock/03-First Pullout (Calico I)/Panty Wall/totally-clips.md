# Description
This route is a pretty fun route, but its otherwise cool nature is somewhat diminished by the flexing flakes that you use for holds, sometimes including the ones you are clipping from. The small and sustained nature of this climb gives it its grade, not the individual moves, which are probably only moderate 5.10.Approach Panty Wall and walk to the far left, up a broad sloping gully to a very steep wall. At the left end of this wall is a flat face with a flake near the bottom. The crux, if I recall is about 1/2-way up the route.Crimp and layback for 60 feet or so, passing 6 bolts to fixed rap anchors.# Location
