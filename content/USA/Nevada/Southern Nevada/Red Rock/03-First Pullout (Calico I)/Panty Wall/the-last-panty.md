# Description
A fine first lead and/or warm up climb on the Panty Wall, on the second bolt line from the right.# Location
# Protection
6 bolts, and a two bolt anchor on top. The anchors on this route are a bit far back, and a cordalette is handy for extending them down enough to prevent major rope drag.
