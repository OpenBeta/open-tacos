# Description
Great climb just left of Panty Prow.  Start on a block and use handholds to 1st bolt.  Past this it's all smearing feet with basically no hands.  Not too steep, very sustained difficulty.# Location
Head up to Panty Wall and then head up a steep gully slightly to the left.# Protection
Nice bolts replaced early 2006,  rap anchor.
