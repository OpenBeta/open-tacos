# Description
Fantastic route for the grade!  I wouldn't say there is truly a crux on this climb but it would be constant 5.8 and fun.  Sport route up a steepening wall with good holds.  Excellent route!# Location
This route is the first sport route right of the large obvious black varnish section on the Panty wall and just barely right on the pine tree.  You can't miss it, just follow the bolts!# Protection
Total sport route with 6 bolts and chain anchors at the top just over the lip on the varnished wall.  Safe and well protected, go for it!
