# Description
All the holds are obvious, due to the excessive chalk.  First three bolts are all .12 moves.  Start on a ledge; you can go either straight up to the first bolt, which is more difficult, or move right off the deck up to a ledge of good holds and travers to the first bolt.  After the fourth bolt, the pressure eases up considerably (maybe .7 or .8), with longer distances between bolts.# Location
# Protection
6 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.
