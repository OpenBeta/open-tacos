# Description
This is the right-most 'route' of the right-most buttress of Panty Wall.Approach Panty Wall via the normal trail. Start up and right on the ramp at the wall's base, trying hard not to step on or be bumped off by one of the 3 dozen climbers standing on it on any given day...Pass the standard up/down scramble, a 4th class gully splitting the wall, then pass a few small crack systems to reach a short curved crack and flake at the wall's right end. This is moderate in difficulty and memory dictates that it is a mere 5m high. Climb up and into the crack (crux), then to the top (5.5?).Walk off right or to the left and scramble down the little gully.# Location
# Protection
A light standard rack, by some reports (I did not protect). Were it not for the possibility for quite a tumble from the ledge below this route, it would probably be considered a boulder problem by most people.t
