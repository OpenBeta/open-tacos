# Description
Another excellent sport route at the Panty Wall.  Pull a really fun move down low, then constant 5.8 climbing all the way to the anchors.  Offers good fun moves through a steepening wall that is really amazing for the grade.# Location
This is the third sport route to the right from the pine tree and is obvious with a short vertical wall section as your first move right off the ledge# Protection
Sport route with 7 bolts to chain anchors just over the varnished edge at top of wall. Anchors now have stainless steel quicklinks and rap rings. Hopefully people don't start toproping off them.
