# Description
The right-hand climb on the front of the formation. Climb a short, steep left leaning crack to a big break under a roof. Pull out the roof and make a long move to gain a very suspect hold, then surmount the bulge to a series of overhanging varnished cracks to its high shared anchor with Climb Warp.# Location
# Protection
Single rack to 2". 2 bolts. You could probably place a #3 Camalot, but I didn't.
