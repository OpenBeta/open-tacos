# Description
The only reason I did not give this thing four stars is the fact that the holds seem fragile in places.  However, this is a great route.  Start off of the top of the boulder at the right end of the cliff.  Through the first section there is some questionable rock, but you can avoid pulling on it by using some of the sweet pockets that show up just when you want them.Once past the first two bolts, you will find yourself at a rest at a horizontal break below the bulge above.  Here is where the pump clock starts.  Work your way up through very positive, and sometimes fragile holds, through rock that is steeper than it looks.  Fight through a cryptic crux and hold on through some more pumpy climbing to the top.# Location
This is the left most route on the wall.# Protection
7 bolts to anchors
