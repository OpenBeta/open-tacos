# Description
Another pumpy route that would be classic if some of the fragile holds cleaned up. Start with the same two or three moves of Celebrity Roast and begin heading right.  Climb towards a cool flake feature that enables you to reach high and clip the third bolt.  From here climb up shallow corner with small holds to a pumpy finish on large, fragile seeming holds.# Location
This route is on the right hand side of the cliff, between Celebrity Roast and Prime Ticket.# Protection
6 bolts to anchor.  The anchor for this route is a bit old, but there are new chains on Celebrity Roast about 2 feet left.
