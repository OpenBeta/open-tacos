# Description
SSHHHH!!! not so loud!This is the easiest sport route at the cliff, and climbing with quiet feet my help you stay on the set, since the holds are kind of fragile, so keep it down already.So the first bolt on this has a homemade hanger that looks like it is as thin as a piece of paper, the climbing seems to head left when the bolts head right, but this route isn't really all that bad.  I wouldn't come here just for this one, but it serves as a good warm up for the cliff.Start on the left end of the wall, and head up the arete like feature.  The holds are not very obvious and the route wanders a bit.  However, the unique nature of some of the holds makes this worth doing.We also found it difficult in places to not stem across the corner to the left.# Location
This is the left-most route on the cliff.# Protection
