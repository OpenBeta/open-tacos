# Description
If you are searching for stars, I gave this route three of them.  You might be wondering why three stars at the start of this climb, but by the time you get to the top you'll know this is a good route for sure.  Begin just left of Celebrity Roast, and head up and left through some slightly crumbly rock.  Head up some thin holds to a huge layback that seems like it will detach at any second....still wondering why three stars? Once past this section head through the cool layback features to a bulge.  Once here head up on some killer edges up to the crux where a sea of hand-hold look-a-likes hang out.  Here you must paw around until you find the right holds, and make a big move, far above the second to last bolt.  Clip, breathe a sigh of relief and climb up a few more pumpy holds to the top.# Location
This is the second from the left.# Protection
6 or 7 bolts to anchor.
