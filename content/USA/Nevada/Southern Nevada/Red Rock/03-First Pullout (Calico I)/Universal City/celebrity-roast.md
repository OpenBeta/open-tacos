# Description
You'll be on center stage with this, the center most route on the crag.  Don't climb too slowly or your forearms will be roasted like Charlie Sheen on Comedy Central. Start with a tricky boulder problem to get off the ground and follow the face up to the first bulge.  Pull through some small crimps through the first bulge to make your way to a brief rest below the second bulge.  Here fight your way through the pump as you encounter more technical, crimpy face climbing.  This thing is pretty on you from start to finish.# Location
