# Description
Climb the unprotected slab/face to a jug, small ledge, and the base of the crack. Climb up the obvious, super fun crack to a 2 bolt anchor up and left at the top of the cliff.****NOTE: There is a lot of loose rock at the top of this wall. While most of the lower wall is protected from the potential rock fall from the top by a large ledge, please exercise extreme caution. Rappelling is not recommended! There is an easy descent gully on the climbers right.# Location
from "Rounders", climb up the slab\gully on right to the base of the obvious crack in the upper right side of the wall# Protection
