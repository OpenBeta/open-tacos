# Description
Climb up past the right side of block down low and power up the gently overhanging face on mostly good holds.Originally bolted on rappel (sans top-roping) with a scant two bolts to make a sporty lead which was then lead without rehearsal. This could be one reason why this and the other climbs on the crag were chopped, as it epitomized the "previewed, runout rappel-bolted route"...some of which was certainly true.Current guidebooks list this as K-9.# Location
This route lies in the center of the wall, just right of the routeDog Logic (aka Here Kitty, Kitty).# Protection
5 bolts, anchors
