# Description
On the way to Jessica's Wall you'll walk along the top of this hidden slot. Climbs the wasting chimney until it becomes a squeeze. Fight through the near holdless interior until it opens behind you and you step out onto the approach path again. Would require very large gear to protect.. originally soloed. A solid step up from Plumber's Crack.# Location
# Protection
Largest Big Bros or solo.
