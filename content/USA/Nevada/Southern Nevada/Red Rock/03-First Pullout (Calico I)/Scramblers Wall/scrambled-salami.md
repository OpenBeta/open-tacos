# Description
Face-climb to a horizontal crack to place gear until you get to a long sloping-up-and-right ledge. Up a little more to a steep bulge with a right facing crack. Go over the bulge by first heading up a move on the left (layback). After the bulge, face-climb a short distance to a small ledge, then head up a crack system. When you are a few feet below the top, traverse left over a mini staircase-like spot to the anchor.# Location
Left-of-middle of Scrambler's Wall--up a short sandstone ramp and starting to the right of a scrub oak. There is an easy walk-off.# Protection
Small gear up to two inches. 2 bolt anchor at the top.
