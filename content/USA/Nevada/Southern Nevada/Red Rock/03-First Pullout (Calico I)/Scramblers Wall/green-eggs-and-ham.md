There are three main cracks on this wall. Green Eggs and Ham is the right-most one. Follow the vertical crack to begin with, then climb through a run-out section to a left-facing dihedral. Some loose rock, so step carefully.# Location
Walk-off to the climber's left. 10 minutes.# Protection
Standard to 3". Trad anchor if you follow the crack, or a bolted anchor to the left of the climb up top.
