# Description
This is a fun route, similar in style to the other sport routes at the Hamlet.  Similarly, it is bolted for someone leading the grade.  It's pretty juggy through the steeper part, to a slabby topout.# Location
Walk past the lower tier TR anchors and make an exposed 3rd class move or two to the right to get to a belay anchor, two brown painted bolts in a varnished scoop.  Belay this as necessary.  Follow the line of brown painted bolts up the seam to the anchor at a small stance.# Protection
6 bolts, anchor with mussy hooks, belay anchor.  60m rope fine.
