# Description
Gildenstern was turned into a multipitch route by adding the first pitch to the lower tier of The Hamlet, far right side. One belay bolt can be found below the line. Rap rings were installed at the base of the second pitch. First move getting started might be 5.9-ish. Fun mantle to reach P1 anchors.# Location
Below Gildenstern, far right side of lower tier of The Hamlet.# Protection
8 bolts
