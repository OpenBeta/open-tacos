# Description
Coolest route on the upper tier. Start in the chimney and climb through a crimpy bulge to easier climbing above. At the crux, clip the bottom link of the chain to protect from a ledge fall.Belayer may want a helmet, as small pebbles and sand tend to get kicked off by the climber.# Location
Belay position is completely shaded and out of sight at the bottom of a comfy 2.5' wide 6' deep crack easily accessible by walking to the end of the narrow gully past a tree and around a huge wedged boulder.# Protection
9 bolts lead up to chains with draw friendly rap rings.
