# Description
Guildenstern climbs the slabby arete on the right edge of the Hamlet.  The position is quite good for a route with such a modest grade.# Location
This is the right-most route on the Hamlet.  Access is the same as Rosencrantz - walk past all the TR anchors to several exposed 3rd class moves to the Rosencrantz belay anchors and continue to the right to another set of brown painted bolts on the prow.  Belay here.  The route steps right off the belay and follows tan painted bolts up the arete to an anchor just below the top of the crag.  With a little exposed down-scrambling, it would be feasible to set a TR from these anchors, if one was so inclined.# Protection
8 bolts, double-ring anchor, belay anchor at base.
