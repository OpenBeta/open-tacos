# Description
A great route up the center of the steep south-facing wall. Begin by climbing easily up a slab which quickly turns to vertical and then overhangs. At the steepest part of the wall execute a long reach/throw for a good incut, then immediately move to jugs which allow for recovery. Following this the route remains pumpy and sustained right to the anchor.# Location
# Protection
8 bolts plus anchor.
