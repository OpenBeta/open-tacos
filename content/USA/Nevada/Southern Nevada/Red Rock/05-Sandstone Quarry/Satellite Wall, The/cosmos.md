# Description
This is a good variation to Supernova, but it has some loose holds down low. It doesn't require the big move found on that route, but it does demand some power endurance especially on the upper half. Begin up Supernova, but after clipping the third bolt step hard right and diagonal up and right past two cruxy sections separated by a poor shake to a chain anchor.# Location
# Protection
8 bolts plus anchor.
