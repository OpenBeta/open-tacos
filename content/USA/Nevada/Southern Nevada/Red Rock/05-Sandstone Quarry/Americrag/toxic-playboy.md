# Description
A few bolts have been added to the lower pitch providing a very nice 12a pitch. The upper pitch is considerably harder than the 12b rating the Handren book gives it. Probably 12c/d.# Location
First route on the left side of the cliff. The crux (on the 1st pitch) is a pumpy section in the middle of the pitch.The top pitch was beyond my climbing ability. So I'm just guessing at the 12c/d rating.# Protection
