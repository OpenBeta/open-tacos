# Description
This climb is out at the end of the pier and out of site until you climb out onto the sloping ledge (careful!).From there, climb up and left for a few moves, then up and right past protection bolts to the top anchor. Rap off to reach the base of the climb again.# Location
If you were to take a long walk off of the short pier, you'd fall right past this route.To approach it from the base, however, you would walk down the gully left of the pier (north) and out around the end to belay below it on a big sloping ledge.# Protection
8 good bolts to a 2-bolt anchor with rap rings
