# Description
Jug-o-rama. This climb is big moves mostly to big holds with a few smaller ones up top just as you are pumped and ready to finish the climb. Interesting and big movements. Easier than the other 5.11's nearby.# Location
This route is about 1/2 way down the Pier Gully and if you walk down and just think jugs jugs jugs as you progress down, inspecting each route, this one will be the one you will intuatively pick.# Protection
6 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor.
