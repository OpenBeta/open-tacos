# Description
This route was not so much fun and has harder moves than other 12Ds at Red Rocks.  It is a bit crumbly too.  Start with some easy climbing and then a harder pull to a slopping pocket.  A big reach and then some lock-off moves lead to sharp pockets and crimps near the anchors.  Although it is short, it is pretty powerful.# Location
The climb to the right of Thirsty Quail.  Follows a slightly right slanting seem.# Protection
