# Description
This is the classic route on the cliff. Look for the hueco half way up the route. The Crux is very crimpy and technical and involves a high step and long balancy reach.Apparently a hold in the crux has crumbled and it's now harder.# Location
Half way down the wall. There is a large Hueco half way up. You will also notice more chalk on this one than most of the other routes as this is the most popular route on the cliff.# Protection
