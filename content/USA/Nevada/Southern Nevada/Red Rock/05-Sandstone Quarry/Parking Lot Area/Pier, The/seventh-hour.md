# Description
This climb is pumpy and has small balancy holds and moves. A majority of these would not be hard but for the fact that they are 'facing the wrong way.'  Careful until you get the second clip to avoid a bad fall.# Location
This is the second route in as one descends down the Pier Gully. It is distinguished by side-pull crimpers and pinches most of the way up, lacking hte jugs of other nearby routes.# Protection
5 bolts + slings for the top.  IT could be TR'd after walking down the pier and dropping a few slings and anchors onto the bolts atop it.
