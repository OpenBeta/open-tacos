# Description
To get to the route, reverse direction onto the right shoulder near the far end of the corridor.  Walk this ledge until it ends at a steep ramp. The route follows the obvious finger crack about 20' up the ramp.  Follow the crack past a depression, until another thin crack appears on the right, and then both peter out.  From there, make delicate face moves to a bolt, then easier moves on softer rock past a second bolt and a slight bulge.# Location

Nuts and small cams, two QDs.
