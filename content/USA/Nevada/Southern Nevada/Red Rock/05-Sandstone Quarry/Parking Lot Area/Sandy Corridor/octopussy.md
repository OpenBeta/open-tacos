# Description
!!! This route tops out with no anchor, and no convenient option for a gear anchor.   There are large boulders 25' back; sling one or more with the rope and extend a master point back to the top of the climb.Some holds are probably loose; be careful.Descend by walk-off to climber's left, or rap from bolted anchors at the base ofFresh Air(climber's right, back and down a bit).# Location
Hike up Sandy Corridor, then scramble/slab your way up to the wall belowChrysler Crack.  This is the leftmost of the two bolted lines.# Protection
