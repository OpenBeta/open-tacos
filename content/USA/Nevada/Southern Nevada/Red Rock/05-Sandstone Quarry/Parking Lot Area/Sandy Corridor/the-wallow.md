# Description
This irresistible route makes a great introduction to chimney climbing and a great place to practice a variety of chimney climbing techniques. Starts as an offwidth/squeeze chimney and gradually widens until a stem or body bridge technique must be used near the top.# Location
Just inside the Sandy Corridor on the right. This chimney separates the first rock formation from the larger formation further inside the corridor. Easy walk-off to the right leads down to the mouth of the corridor.# Protection
There are 2 bolts at the top of the formation but you will need an extra rope or a lot of webbing (maybe 30'?) to get a top rope set up in the right place.  There is also a 3"-4" pod above the climb that might be useful as a directional.
