# Description
Chrysler Crack is a classic off-width romp located high over the Sandstone Quarry with a beautiful splitter crack in a dihedral and two featureless faces. In the first half of the climb you can choose to lieback the crack or employ off-width jamming and in the second half the crack is wide enough to chimney. Walk off left.# Location
Approach from Sandstone Quarry as per Sandy Corridor description. Hike the Corridor a couple hundred yards until you're about 30 yards from the end of the canyon. You'll see a (mostly dead) left-leaning pine tree. Go right here to a robbers den that pinches off into a narrow slot. Break right and up to ledges, past occasional easy fifth-class moves for about 150 feet until you arrive at the base of the climb.# Protection
There is no fixed protection on this route. Bring armloads of big cams and big bros - Camalot C4 #5 and Big Bro #3 didn't cut the mustard.
