# Description
(one of those nasty) 5.9+Begin directly below the vertical thin crack, seam. Climb past one bolt up into a gentle wave/bulge on smeary footing. It is easier to climb to the left of the bottom of the crack and step right into the crack up a few feet. The rest of the climb in the fingers, thin hands to hands crack is a fun romp to the top. The belay is a primo comfy ledge with excellent (yet funky) anchor or gear bckup.This would be a very serious lead in its grade and best top roped unless you are solid at leading 5.10 - 5.10+  Unfortunately it is not well protected at the crux (close to ground fall with one bolt stud). If it were better protected down low this could be a 2-star route and perhaps would see a lot more leads.# Location
The obvious slab to thin crack line, that is 20 feet left of 'The Ring Leader' and about 35 left of the large unnamed offwidth corner.# Protection
standard light free rack, mostly smaller gear but you may want a couple cams in the #2 -# size for the top of the crack. The anchor is two huge iron spikes beat into a nice splitter crack. I think they could haul up a cement truck but if you wish you can back these up with a cam or two in the #2.5 - #3.5 range.As of January 2015, the route has been equipped with glue-in bolts in the bottom section. There are also glue-in anchor bolts at the top.
