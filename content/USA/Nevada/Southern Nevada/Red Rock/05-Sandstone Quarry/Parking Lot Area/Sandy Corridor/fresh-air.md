# Description
Start under the roof on big flat edges. Big powerful moves up right to some good but questionable edges. Then back left. One hold near the second bolt looks like it may have broken, making the first crux reachy or really strenuous if you're short. Then pull onto the slab for a series of delicate and balancy moves on side pulls and under clings to gain more positive edges. Full on adventure arete climbing to yet another delicate slab move up higher, then jugs for the last 10 feet or so. Definitely a heads up route that will get the heart pumping! Really fun!# Location
Beautiful arete to the right of Chrystler Crack.# Protection
8 draws. One longer one for the last roof is helpful for rope drag.
