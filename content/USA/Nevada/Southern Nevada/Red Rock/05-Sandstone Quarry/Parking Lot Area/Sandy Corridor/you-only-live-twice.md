# Description
!!! This route tops out with no anchor, and no convenient option for a gear anchor.   There are large boulders 25' back; sling one or more with the rope and extend a master point back to the top of the climb.Technical and balancy.  Be careful about not pulling too hard, and choose footholds carefully.Descend by walk-off to climber's left, or rap from bolted anchors at the base ofFresh Air(climber's right, back and down a bit).# Location
Hike up Sandy Corridor, then scramble/slab your way up to the wall belowChrysler Crack.  This is the rightmost of the two bolted lines.# Protection
8 bolts, no anchor.   R-rated getting to the 2nd bolt; a large offset cam might protect this in a flaring crack
