# Description
Located on the near vertical wall about 70 feet from where the corridor ends and opposite, Churning the Dirt.  Look for two lines with their first bolts below a wide horizontal crack.  This is the right/south of the two.  Climb past the first bolt placing a 1 or 2 cam in the horizontal (optional). Continue up thin, technical face on gray and red sandstone to reach the anchors.# Location
Front Corridor, Sandstone Quarry.# Protection
12 draws, medium cam, 70 meter rope.  Handran's guide recommends 6 draws. I recall using more.
