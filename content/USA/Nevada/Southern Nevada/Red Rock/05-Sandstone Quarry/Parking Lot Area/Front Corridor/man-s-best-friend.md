# Description
A closely bolted, enjoyable climb that heads straight up slabby white rock on pitch one, then into rippling red on the second. The view is great all the way up and the rock itself is a pleasure to climb on.  An excellent introduction to multi-pitch climbing for those so inclined.# Location
Located about 150 yards from the parking area, the first pitch is hidden by the fin of rock that forms the east wall of Front Corridor. Use hidden rappel anchors to drop down into the corridor and get to the base of the climb.# Protection
First pitch is 90 feet and has 8 bolts, second pitch is also 90 feet with 10 bolts. Decent belay ledge halfway up with a secure hanging belay at the top.
