# Description
This route is more of a mind game than others, due to the height of the first bolt. (This is also why I gave it a PG-13 rating.) Otherwise a fun route, that is long enough to serve as a warm-up for the routes on the opposing wall.# Location
This route is the second to last route on the east (right) side of the corridor. You have to walk nearly all the way to the back of the corridor to reach the start.# Protection
7 bolts to anchors.
