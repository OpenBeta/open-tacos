# Description
Added November 2016 by the industrious Dan McQuade.  Follow about 6 new bolts up the gray slab face just to the right of To Bolt or Toupee.  Climb thin technical face just behind a large bush/small tree to reach the first bolt.  Follow the new bolts up and to the right of the roof of Toupee. Continue past the right side of the roof to gain the lip of the large (8ft scoop). Make balance moves to get to a 3 bolt anchor.  At the time of this writing several holds were fragile and this route may become harder with time.# Location
Front Corridor, Sandstone Quarry.# Protection
Bring 11 quickdraws plus an optional sling to clip an intermediate anchor.The top anchor is lower-off hooks
