# Description
Work some juggy holds through the first bolt, where thin, positive crimps trend leftward into a short traverse. The pump carries directly into the arguably single-move crux of the route. Get your feet right, manage your pump, and its over. The remainder of the route is simply good, technical climbing. Crimps, high-feet, and a couple of lovely jugs.I managed to break off two or three holds, and its admittedly still a bit sandy, but the movement is very good! A worthy route that will clean up nicely. Give this thing some love!# Location
