# Description
This is a pretty cool route with an old school feel.  Not a casual sport route for the 5.9 leader.  The bolts have some space between them and the heady move to gain the scoop at the top is protected by some cams in a small flaring crack.  The cams are probably solid pieces but I'd put 2 in there to be sure.  You can descend by walking off to the right.  Since this is in plain view of the parking lot, expect a crowd of spectators to gather!# Location
This is the right most line that you will find as you enter the Front Corridor.# Protection
3 bolts, Red/Yellow Alien sized cam for the heady top out.  2 bolt anchor(not shuts) at the top as of 4/09.
