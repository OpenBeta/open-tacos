# Description
The thin flakes seem to keep breaking, which lead to the rating change from 5.12a to 5.12b. After the publishing of Roxanna Brock's new guide another flake broke on a gaston move, resulting in locals raising the grade another letter to 5.12c.Easy climbing to the first bolt turns difficult quickly as you encounter a thin crimp. Some technical footwork leads you higher (3rd bolt) where you enter the second crux sequence, including a gaston to a small broken flake. IF you can pull through this move the difficulty eases and the anchors await.# Location
This is the third route from the far end of the corridor on the West side. It is next to Sunsplash (5.13b).# Protection
Several bolts to chain anchors.
