# Description
I recently watched some accomplished climbers flailing on this route. It is know as one of the testpieces for Red Rocks... unfortunately I don't climb 13s! =) It is considered a classic line if you are capable of pulling the moves off the drilled pockets.# Location
This is the second route from the far end of the corridor on the West side. It is the obvious line on the left.# Protection
Several draws are hanging for your convenience; Please leave them there...
