# Description
Three bolts of low 5.10 jugs leads to two bolts of thin, technical crimping on a slightly overhung face. Pull into the lie down rest, then tackle the relaxing headwall to the anchors. An excellent warmup for the insanity that lies deeper in the corridor.# Location
The first route on the steep left side of the corridor.# Protection
7 bolts to fixed biners
