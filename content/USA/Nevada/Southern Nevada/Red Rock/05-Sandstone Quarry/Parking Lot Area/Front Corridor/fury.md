# Description
Balancey start to first bolt, using back wall may help. Not a super steep route but tricky and technical throughout. This is not the best rock in the park, and the route has not had many ascents-so the thing is still a bit chossy in spots. There is a nice chimney rest at the top just before going for the chains.# Location
This is the last route on the right side wall as you enter the corridor. It is way back where the corridor chimneys out.# Protection
7 bolts and chain anchors
