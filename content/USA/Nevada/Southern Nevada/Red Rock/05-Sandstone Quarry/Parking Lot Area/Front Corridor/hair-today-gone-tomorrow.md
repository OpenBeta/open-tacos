# Description
Summon up focus to climb this long bolted line to the top.  Located climbers right of Toupee and the new, unnamed route, this line requires a 70 meter rope. Locate the base of the route by selecting the left of two lines that have their second bolts above a wide horizontal crack.  Climb past the first bolt, placing a .5 or .75 cam (optional), in the horizontal to reach the second bolt.  Continue up a long seam, trending left.  Spacing between bolts increases with distance from the ground.  Pass through various degrees of quality red sandstone to reach the anchors.# Location
Walk to the rear/north end of the Front Corridor. Located on the east/right side of the corridor opposite Sunsplash.# Protection
Handran's guide recommends 8 bolts. My experience is that 12 should be carried.
