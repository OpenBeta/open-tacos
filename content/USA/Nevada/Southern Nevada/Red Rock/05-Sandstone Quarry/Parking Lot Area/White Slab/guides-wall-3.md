# Description
The base of the route is the crux.  It is a slabby area with few handholds.  It is a fun slabby problem.  If you arms are pumped this slab could be the solution.# Location
This route is to the right of Guides Wall #2.  It is the second worn crack/seam to the right of Fender Bender.# Protection
This route has a set of chains at the top.
