# Description
The base of the route is the crux.  There are few hand and footholds.  As you climb the footholds become more available.# Location
The route is just to the right of Fender Bender.  The base is a slab, then follow the heavily worn crack.  It is a fun route.# Protection
Top rope only there are no places to place protection.  This route shares the chains with Fender Bender.
