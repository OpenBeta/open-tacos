# Description
This route starts out with some 10+/11- climbing up to a huge ledge. The crux involves the process of moving out onto the roof holds and then pulling over the roof. I suggest a heel-hook, as it is very well-protected... so GO FOR IT! The top is more 10+/11- climbing, and really more a matter of fighting off a pump.# Location
This is the only south-facing route in the main alcove. It is the obvious chalked line that climbs out over a roof.# Protection
5 bolts and the anchors.
