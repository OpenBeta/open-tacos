# Description
Significantly harder than "Just in from L.A.", and I found this route to be long, somewhat overhanging, and tiring. The crux involves clipping and moving past the 4th bolt. Again, be sure to tie a stopper knot in the belay end of the rope depending on where you belay from.# Location
Start 100' left of the main alcove of California Crag, and immediately right of Cal. West, on the overhanging red arete.# Protection
8 bolts and an anchor.
