# Description
This route has some really fun moves at the bottom through the roof/crack system, and then some technique sequences toward the top. The Swain book rates it 5.11b, but I think 5.11- is generous... Be sure to have a spotter to protect you should you fall through the lower crux (have them stand on the boulder).# Location
Directly to the right of "Far Cry from Josh", you start atop the huge block and climb up and to the right.# Protection
4 bolts to an anchor.
