# Description
Getting over the roof appears to be the crux, but still quite hard after that. The upper section turned out to be much chossier than first expected. The first ascent is open for anyone wanting to bag it. It was well beyond my ability.# Location
5 feet left of senseless. Climbs through the small roof and up the left leaning seam.# Protection
