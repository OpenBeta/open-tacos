# Description
There are good holds that you can use to pull through the small roof.  Rely on solid feet and nice crimps to cruise to the top.# Location
This route climbs the north-facing wall of the alcove and is the farthest east of the routes. Climb over a small roof and continue up through a series of crimps. This route is east of the huge boulder sitting in the opening.# Protection
4 bolts to an anchor.
