# Description
This route combines some slab climbing (not my forte) with some face climbing. It is a long warm-up. Be sure to tie a knot in the belay end of your rope if using a 50m cord, especially if belaying from down the ramp!# Location
When you reach the alcove of California Crag, head west about 100' on a white slab. It's the red arete about 30' right of a water streak.# Protection
8 bolts to anchors (This is an update to the Swain book which says 6 bolts... apparently 2 more were added).
