# Description
The base of the route is the crux.  There are no good foot holds and tricky handholds.  The route gets easier as you ascend.  The stone is very soft so I expect good handholds will break off.# Location
The route is dead center of the cliff and dead center of the two bolts.# Protection
Top rope only.  There is a set of bolts. They are about 6' back from the face and about 4' apart.  Two cordelettes are needed to rig an anchor that extends down the face.
