# Description
Little Red climbs a right facing dihedral and arete up 30 short but sweet ft. The movement is super varied and completely fun on this compact, treat of a route. The only gripe I've ever heard about this line is that people wish it were 100ft. longer.# Location
Pass north through the A-frame roof feature which makes up the western end of the Hidden Corridor proper and scramble up boulders for 50ft., until you reach an obvious right facing dihedral.# Protection
Single rack to 1.75".Chain anchor.
