# Description
This route might be best approached as a head point (as we did), and possibly with a few crashpads. The landing is littered with boulders and the first piece of gear is placed after the crux. Begin the route (refer to location). The climbing starts off with feet on a low angled section of white/brown rock and hands on the steeper section of undercut blocky rock above. Climb rightward through varnished crimps angling for a "pod," in the middle of a seam feature. From this "pod," follow the seam and flake as they wander slightly left and ultimately disappear into lower angled white rock. Continue up easy but unprotected slab until you top out on the formation and can build an anchor (refer to location). Place gear where you can on this route because it is sparse.# Location
"Gonzo," is 35ft. to climber's left of "Little Red." Begin just right of the boulder choked section of the path, under the overhanging brown varnished wall, and a racquetball sized human nose feature. At the top of the climb where the ground levels off, locate a vertical slot to the climber's left in which a #2,3, & 4 Camalot can be placed to build an anchor. Walk off to the southeast as described in the other Hidden Corridor postings.# Protection
3 or 4 finger sized cams ( I think we used something like 2 yellow metolius, 1 orange metolius and a .4 camalot. I can't quite recall ). RP's. 1 each of #'s 2,3, & 4 Camalots for the anchor, plus cord to extend for a top rope scenario.
