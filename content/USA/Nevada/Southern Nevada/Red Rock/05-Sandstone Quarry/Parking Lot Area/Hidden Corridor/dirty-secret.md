# Description
This climb while offering fun climbing has a lot to be desired in rock quality.  Start up chossy rock to a high first bolt through a cool thread in the rock.  This part is easy but scary due to the rock quality.  After the 1st bolt continue up to hard moves passing the second bolt and a nice rest at the bottom of large Hueco.  Navigate your way past the Hanta out of the Hueco and pull some more hard moves to get to the last bolt.  From there some balancy climbing gets you to the anchors.# Location
There are now 4 bolted routes in the main part of Hidden Corridor (Not including Hidden Edge).  Continue past the two new routes by about 50' past the narrow part of the canyon.  This is the route closest to the entrance.  To the left is "Sandy Secrets"# Protection
