# Description
This isn’t in the most recent Handren book, and I don’t know the route name. If anyone has FA info and grade, please fix it. Also take the 5.10 grade with a grain of salt because I’m the worst at assigning grades.Scramble over crumbly rock up the gully on easier terrain, using a few solid holds to the first 2 bolts. Or mantle the large ledge on the right, and use better holds to traverse left and through the first 2 bolts. The mantle start seemed better but a little harder. Crux seemed to be reaching the chains. But the true crux was for my belayer, who was dodging loose rock without short-roping, and getting dusted with constantly crumbling feet.Fun despite the length and rock quality, but I’m always stoked to climb anything.# Location
Access via the “A-frame” corridor located on the west end of the Hidden Corridor proper, near Hidden Edge. After passing The Blob, Little Red, Gonzo and a few other routes, you’ll reach an apparent dead-end where the white rock turns to red. The route starts on the south face of the red rock guarding access to the rest of the gully.Note there’s a bolted rap station on the west wall (climber’s left) of the gully, opposite a piton. It can be reached by climbing through the first 2 bolts, then left past the small tree to the chains. I haven’t explored the rest of the gully, but this is the last of several undocumented sport routes through the A-frame corridor.# Protection
