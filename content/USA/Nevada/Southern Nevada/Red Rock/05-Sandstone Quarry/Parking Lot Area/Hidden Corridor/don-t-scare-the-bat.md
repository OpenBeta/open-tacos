# Description
Start at the left of two large huecos.  Work your way past 6 bolts on some pockets, sidepulls and edges to a two bolt anchor.This is a fairly new route, and has a sandy, fragile feel to it.  This route will be good with more traffic.I found this route difficult to rate because it has a boulder problem start that took me 5 or 6 tries to get and then it is 5.10 to the top.# Location
This is the next route left of Hidden Edge.# Protection
6 bolts to anchors
