# Description
This is not your typical Red Rocks' sport route. The climbing is more akin to Joshua Tree in style and finale (slabbery with a top out finish). Begin by standing on a boulder with your left hand on a big sidepull, and right hand in the seam. Twenty ft. of bouldery moves through vertical terrain, lead to 40 ft. of sustained, technical horizontal movement across a super thin arcing rail. Top out, there  is no anchor on the face. A bolted anchor exists 3 feet beyond the top out. To descend, walk off from the climb 50 or so yards to the east where you will be deposited at the east end of the 'Hidden Corridor,' proper.# Location
Start at the bolted seam 15 ft. right of 'Little Red.'# Protection
