# Description
You'll be climbing the beautifully tiger striped wall, right of the sharp arÃªte, that is both concave and angular. The rock is perfect on this one. Stand start matched with a crimp rail at chest/head height in the concave and feet smearing. Move the left hand up over the roof onto a vertical crimp and begin a series of contortionist movements that have you palming out right, high stepping, body scumming and bumping through some edges. Top out directly through the looming Aron Ralston boulders. They seem solid!# Location
20 ft. to climber's right of Dusty Taco.# Protection
Crash pads and spotters.
