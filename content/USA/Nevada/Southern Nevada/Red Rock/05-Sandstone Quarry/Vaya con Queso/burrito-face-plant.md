# Description
Big moves, finger locks, jugs, slopers and crimps. This mini route is action packed and has it all.# Location
The only bolted line on the cliff.# Protection
5 bolts to a bolted anchor. Stick clip or stand on the rock pile to hang the first draw. Begin the actual climbing down and left of the first bolt on a jug under the roof. Using a single carabiner on the 2nd bolt is recommended.
