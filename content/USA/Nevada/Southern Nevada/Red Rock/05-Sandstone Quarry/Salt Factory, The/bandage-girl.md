# Description
Begin at about the low point of the formation, just to the right of a scrub oak (and where Matt is standing in the photo). Follow discontinuous cracks up and slightly left through the fractured white face, aiming for a varnished and overhanging off width at the top. The first 2/3 of the route feels like a seldom traveled (sandy-ish) white rock adventure out in the canyons. The off width is the crux and is bullet varnish. To descend, walk from the west edge to the east for 30ft., chimney down to the left for ten feet and hug the wall to the right past scrub oak.# Location
The obvious fractured crack system on the west face of The Salt Factory.# Protection
Single rack of cams through Black Diamond #5. Build an anchor on top.
