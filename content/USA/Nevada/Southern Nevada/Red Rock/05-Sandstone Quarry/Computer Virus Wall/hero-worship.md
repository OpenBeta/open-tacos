# Description
There are a couple of hard moves before the first bolt, which is pretty high off the ground. There is a bad landing here so climb cautiously on the friable rock. Follow the bolt line and wander left and right, zig-zagging your way up the arete to a two bolt anchor.Overall, the rock quality is pretty rotten but the moves are there and it's a fun route.# Location
Hero Worship climbs the arete that is on the far right side of Computer Virus Wall. This route gets shade in the early morning and in the later afternoon.# Protection
4 bolts and a two bolt anchor.
