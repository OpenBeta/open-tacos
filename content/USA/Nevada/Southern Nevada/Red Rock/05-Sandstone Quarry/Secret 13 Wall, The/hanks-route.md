# Description
One of the most fun on the wall. Tallest steepest part of the wall. Start on a little tree growing sideways out from the base. Long really quality moves, decent rests here and there. Pumpy! Named after The Dude that helped me put the route up. There's even a Giant red H for him on the wall.# Location
Left of Yoshimi, right of where is my mind# Protection
Wave Bolts, mostly fixed climb-tech
