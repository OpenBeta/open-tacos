# Description
Start on left-angling seam with poor feet. Very bouldery moves to second bolt. I would suggest stick clipping 2nd bolt (ya ya, put your ethics aside, I know). Crux is getting to that bolt then clipping off a bad right-hand mono. Then continue straight up dirty edges to seam and dirty jugs to anchor. Needs traffic.# Location
Left side of cliff on cool looking yellow-green-black lichen-colored rock.# Protection
7 bolts, be careful on the start.
