# Description
Just right of Go a Hundred, start on big lefthand flake then up smaller sidepulls and edges to good rest before smooth midsection wall. Bouldery moves to a weird "hole" then even more difficult moves to big rest hole. Straight up decent holds to exciting slabby topout finish. Classic climb on good rock!# Location
