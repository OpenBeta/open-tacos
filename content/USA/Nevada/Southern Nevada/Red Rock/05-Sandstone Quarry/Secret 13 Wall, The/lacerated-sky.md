# Description
Climb to the jug at the 4th bolt of Herbivore. Ignore the bolt just to left, reach pretty far right and clip the draw on Sika 13. Then move slightly right and Finnish on sika 13. Still very pumpy, this makes for a more direct line, yet easier and more enjoyable Finnish. Itâ€™s most likely in the mid 5.13 range. Note* You can clip the 4th bolt on herbivore then move right but it's more spooky and the rope doesn't run as well.# Location
