# Description
Start 20 ft right of GM Crack off tree limb on big right-hand undercling and left-hand sidepull. Bouldery start, definitely stick clip first bolt. Up creaky holds to rest then straight up slapping sidepulls for a couple bolts, to decent rest on crimp rails, then huck to two-finger pocket and motor up awkward slopey seam then left to anchors. Very sustained climb and fun.# Location
Right of GM Crack behind small bush/tree. The rock that says "GOAHUNDRED".# Protection
9 bolts
