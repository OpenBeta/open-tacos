# Description
The route right of Yoshimi Battles.  Climb the Orange streaked rock, the first move is to a football sized/shape Hueco about 7-8 feet off the ground, from here a few easy moves gets you to a decent edge, get your feet up and DYNO (about 6 feet) to a good pocket.  Follow the bolts to anchor (slightly right, then back left), there are several other big dynamic moves as well.# Location
Secret 13 wall.  Follow the Calico Tanks Trail until you get to a sign-post pointing the trail to the right, here you veer left on a gravel "Climbers trail".  Then veer left again below the big balancing rock into a gully; follow the gravel river-bed to the end, scramble up at the end and then follow rock cairns up some slabs until you get to the far left side of Secret 13 wall.  About a twelve minute walk from the parking lot.Trail to Secret 13 wallTurn left here off main trail.Then walk under big balancing rock and follow the river-bed to the end.# Protection
