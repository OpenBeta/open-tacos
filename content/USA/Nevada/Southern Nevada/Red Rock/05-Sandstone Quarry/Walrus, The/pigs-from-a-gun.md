# Description
Climb the right arete on the back side of the Walrus without pulling around onto the slab. A hard and thin start leads to a brief rest, followed by three bolts of slopey, pumpy, unaesthetic grovelfest, the crux coming right after a long clip to the fourth bolt. Finish on the anchor of Pornographic Priestess. A little sporty and committing.# Location

Bolts to chains.
