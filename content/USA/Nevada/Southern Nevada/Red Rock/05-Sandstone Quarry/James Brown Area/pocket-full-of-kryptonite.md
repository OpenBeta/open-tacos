# Description
"Starting just right of the cave, this route climbs a long varnished streak up a line of shallow huecos and horns. This would be a good route with a bit of traffic."A powerful start on shallow huecos leads to good moves on big crimps. Ample rest before the last punch to the chains. Probably deserves 2.5 stars in its current shape, 3.5 once it's cleaned.# Location
To the right of the Soul Power corridor is a tall wall above a sloping terrace. Towards the right end of the terrace is a shallow cave. The route begins on the dark vertical huecos to the right of the cave.# Protection
11 bolts to chains
