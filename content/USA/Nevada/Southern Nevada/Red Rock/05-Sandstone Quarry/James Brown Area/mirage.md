# Description
Four part climb:  Tricky slab leads to steeper pulls up fragile rock following a seam, then steeper yet up good pumpy incut edges, finally finishing on horrible slopers to the anchor. Well protected, pumpy, and thought provoking. Good fun despite some hollow holds. And kind of a sandbag. :)# Location
Furthest right route at the James Brown area. Way down and right of the previous two routes. Starts off of a big ledge 10' up.# Protection
