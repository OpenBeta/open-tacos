# Description
Another fun route on the numbers crag.  Start by scrambling up some easy rock to a double hueco feature with some big holds to clip the first bolt.  The first hard sequence comes at mid height requiring a bit of a big move.  From there continue up to a technical finish.  There really isn't much of a finishing hold to clip the anchors, so clip then when you can.# Location
Between Number 1 and Number 3, look for the double hueco feature that is just below the first bolt# Protection
5 bolts, anchors
