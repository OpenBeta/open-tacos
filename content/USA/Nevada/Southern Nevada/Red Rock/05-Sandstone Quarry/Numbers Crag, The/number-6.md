# Description
This little gem starts with a long jump to the opening holds (if you're short). The crux section is a bit hard to decipher at first as most of the holds are slopers. A little feeling around will eventually uncover two small edges. The second crux comes at the top and also involves large white slopers. Unfortunately there are no edges to find up here. Try to hang on long enough to get the anchors clipped.# Location
First route on the right side of the cliff.# Protection
