# Description
Start on the junky slab below the gray stripe on the steep face above.  Carefully climb your way up to the first bolt, which is about 20 feet up.  Clip the first bolt, catch your breath, and head up the beautiful, juggy, steep water streak. No hold is smaller than a finger pad, but the route is so steep that you are still working for it.If it were not for the sketchy start to the route, I would give this route four stars.  One of the best steep 12a's in Red Rock.# Location
This route is located near the Hall of Fame area.  Exit the Hall of Fame to the South (the end facing the canyons), and turn right (west) and head towards gullies that lead south and down.  The left most gully is the easiest to negotiate.  Once at the bottom, again head right (west) and look up.  The route sits by itself on a big boulder to the right of a large, smooth scoop feature.# Protection
6 bolts to lower off.
