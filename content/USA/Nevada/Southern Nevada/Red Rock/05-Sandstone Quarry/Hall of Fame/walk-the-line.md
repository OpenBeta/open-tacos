# Description
Thin moves off the ground lead to jugs. Shake out, then punch on through using a variety of technique to follow a thin seam which curves up and right. Move slightly left and follow bolts straight up face to chain anchors. Super fun.# Location
7th bolted route from the left# Protection
5 bolts to chain anchors
