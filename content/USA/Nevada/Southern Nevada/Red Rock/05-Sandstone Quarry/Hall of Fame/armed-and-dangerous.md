# Description
Tricky start leads to some pretty cool climbing up some huecos.  The climbing is good, but the rock is a little but flaky in places.# Location
Located inside the hall of fame, this route is the fifth route from the right. There appears to be more routes here than are in the guide book.# Protection
6 bolts to lower off.
