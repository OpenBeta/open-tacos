# Description
Climb the start of the route that is shared with Yearnin and Learnin, a long leftward traverse around the second or third bolt will see you to the upper part of the route, where you will be trending leftward more than you would think.  Head toward the anchor that is shared with Armed and Dangerous. This route has suspect rock, just like all the others I tried here.# Location
This route is the fourth from the south end. There seems to be a route here that is not in the guidebook.  Making the count of routes here different from the book.# Protection
6 bolts to lower off.
