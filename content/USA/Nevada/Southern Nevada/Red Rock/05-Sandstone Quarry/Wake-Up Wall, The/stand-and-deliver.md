# Description
This route is an action packed thin face climb that gets gently overhung towards the top.  A bouldery start leads to a good rest near the first bolt, and from there it is pretty much a race against the pump clock.Sustained climbing separated by a few places to catch a shake lead to a challenging crux towards the top.  Once past the crux, pull over the bulge at the top and climb the slightly heady slab on rounded, slopey holds.  Full value for 40 feet.In Handren's book this route is rated "12b?" (yes the question mark was included in the rating)and was described as having lost a bunch of holds over the years. This description caused my curiosity to get the better of me so I decided to see what was up with this thing.As far as difficulty is concerned, I can't really say just how hard this thing is, because it is the hardest thing I have tried this year.  However, I can say that it is noticeably harder than "Onsight Fight" (12b) which is a route just to the left (which climbs similarly, with less difficulty).# Location
This route is located two routes to the right of XTZ (the bolted wide crack-like gully thing).  It is the right-most route on the main part of the wall.  (Skidmark is the true right-most route, but it is another 50 yds down the cliff).# Protection
4 bolts to chains
