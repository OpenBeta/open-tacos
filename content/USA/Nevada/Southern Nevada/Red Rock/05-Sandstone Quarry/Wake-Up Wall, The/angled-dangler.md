# Description
This is a fun route with varied climbing. Begin in the pit with a difficult mantle move at the first bolt. Continue up a slabby section that is a bit runout to a huge overhang with several large holds that head left up through the 3rd and 4th bolts. The crux really begins at the 5th bolt where the jugs disappear and you head right on a series of small crimps up a crack system with a hard pull to a patina covered rail below the 6th bolt.More so than most routes, this route might feel harder as an onsight attempt but eases once you have it dialed.# Location
This route is immediately left of 'Shut Up and Climb.' It starts down in the pit and shares the first bolt with another route that heads up and left.# Protection
There are six bolts to the anchor chains.
