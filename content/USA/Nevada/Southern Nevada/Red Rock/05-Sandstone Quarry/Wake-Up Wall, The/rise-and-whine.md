# Description
This route is another pleasant Wake Up Wall surprise.  While it gets no stars in the guidebook, I found it to be quite good.  The crux on this comes about two thirds height, and is followed by a classic wake up wall section of bubbly slopers to get you to the anchor.# Location
This route is just right of The Healer and just left of Pain Check.# Protection
