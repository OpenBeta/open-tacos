# Description
Descent holds and a couple big moves will lead you up this route. The crux is the sustained nature of this route. The business starts at the bottom as you must crimp your way over a small ceiling and then settle the nerves as you go for the jug to your right off a left-handed ringlock. After catching your breath on the jug continue up and right through a series of difficult crimps requiring some technical footwork. Finally you finish through the top on some sloping white sandstone.# Location
This route is located toward the right side of the cliff face, just before/left of the obvious 5.8 offwidth crack/arete.# Protection
Follow the bolts (I think there are 5, and one of them spins) to the anchors.
