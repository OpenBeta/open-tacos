# Description
This is a very fun route worth doing if you visit the Wake-Up Wall.Start off on the crimps down low, up to a juggy sidepull under the patina. Once you match above the third bolt, you can escape towards the right (easier) or take the more direct route up after shifting a few feet right (harder).# Location
Begin two routes left of 'Where Egos Dare,' and climb up left of a small seam.# Protection
Five bolts to the anchors.
