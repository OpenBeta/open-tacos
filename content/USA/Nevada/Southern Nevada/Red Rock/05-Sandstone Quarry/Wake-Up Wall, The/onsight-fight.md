# Description
This is a good route up what I always thought to be a featureless section of stone.  Onsight Flight requires the ability to climb a long series of sustained sloping crimpers with sloping feet on a gently overhanging wall.# Location
This is the first route to the right of XTZ (which is the angling bolted corner).  This route is second to last route on the main part of the cliff.# Protection
5 bolts to chains.
