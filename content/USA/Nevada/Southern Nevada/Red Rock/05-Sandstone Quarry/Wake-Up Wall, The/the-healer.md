# Description
A technical start  and some edges lead to a right angled seam.  A few long pull from here get you to the third bolt and the crux.  Climb a 4 move sequence on super small edges to a jug, and the last bolt.  Easy climbing to the chains.  Pretty darn solid, as most of the routes on this cliff are, for 11d!!!!!# Location
This is the second route from the left on the right portion of the cliff.  It is just left of the 11a, Shape of Things.# Protection
4 bolts and chains.
