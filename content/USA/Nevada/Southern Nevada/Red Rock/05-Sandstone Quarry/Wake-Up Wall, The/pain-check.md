# Description
Sustained technical climbing; moves get harder and rests get worse as you go. Crux just after the fourth bolt, followed by a thin and pumpy push to bolt number five. Shares and anchor with Good Mourning (The Burrito). An excellent climb and hard for the grade.# Location
# Protection
5 bolts to chains.
