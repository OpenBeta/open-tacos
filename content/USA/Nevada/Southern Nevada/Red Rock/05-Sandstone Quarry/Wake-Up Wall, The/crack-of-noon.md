# Description
This route really only serves the purpose of getting the blood flowing on a cold day, and barely that... Good for setting-up a toprope for OTHER people in your party to climb, as there are a couple different lines you could follow up the slab... ;-)# Location
This route is located on the psuedo-slabby middle section of the cliff. It follows the thin crack up the right side of the shorter section of rock on this cliff.# Protection
I used a set of stoppers, but there are a few small cam placements (#.5 to #1 Camalot) also... chains at the top.
