# Description
After you reach the anchors, let out a howl and spill some out for the late, great Ronnie James Dio.  Look up in the sky and one may be lucky enough to see R.J.D. slay a dragon and offer its head to the Metal Gods!Begin in the trough, and climb up through two bolts of techy stuff on patina.  Surmount the very short slab and make a tricky clip of bolt #3.  This will ensure no hitting of the blocks below in the trough and potentially wrecking ankles or femurs.  Grab jugs above the "cave" and clip #4.  Get a shake and pull the bulge on good crimpers to clip #5.  Some easy climbing gets the climber to bolt #6 and a slabby, technical run to the anchors.# Location
This route is located at the far left end of the Wake Up Wall.  As climbers arrive at the cliff it is now the first fully bolted line located between the trad route and mixed route.  Bolt hangers are painted tan/beige in attempt to blend with the rock.# Protection
6 3/8 x 4 inch Powers 5 piece bolts and Mussy hooks for anchors.
