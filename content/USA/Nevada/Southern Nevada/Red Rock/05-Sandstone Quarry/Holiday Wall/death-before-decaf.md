# Description
Begin just to the left of Gift Wrapped and do a few traverse moves left on good varnished holds.  After this, proceed up fun climbing on decent holds to the 4th bolt.  The crux comes here and holds have broken over the years.  After the crux, easier climbing on decent holds leads to the chains.# Location
# Protection
6 bolts and chain anchors.
