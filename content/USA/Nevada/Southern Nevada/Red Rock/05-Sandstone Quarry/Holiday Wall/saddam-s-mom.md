# Description
The best route on the cliff. The crux involves a long move past the third bolt. You can step around left on the ledge to get a rest or climb straight up (this probably makes the route 12a). From the ledge a scary but not as hard as it looks move back around right will get you back into 5.10 climbing to finish the route.# Location
climbs the arete to the right of When the Cat's Away.# Protection
6 bolts
