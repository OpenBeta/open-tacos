# Description
Borrowed from Todd Swain's Classic Rock Climbs: Red Rocks."Given as a Christmas present! Start 8' right of the last route (Death Before Decaf-12b), at a shallow, left-facing corner by a small pine and oak.  Clip 6 bolts as you climb along seams to a chain anchor."Really a 1 move route, rest of it goes at 10something.  Crux is about 1/3 of the way up but the fun doesn't stop until you're at the anchors!# Location
Follows obvious chalked up seam at a left-facing corner.# Protection
6 bolts to chain anchor
