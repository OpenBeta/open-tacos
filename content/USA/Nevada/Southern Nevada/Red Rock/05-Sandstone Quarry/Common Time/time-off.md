# Description
A thin slab leads to interesting yet highly friable sandy slopers, crips and the occasional pocket.  The crux comes at the 4th bolt fighting the pump brought on by grabbing sandy sloppers and crimps.  Clearly a few holds have broken since this route was put up 12 years ago.  The route is a pretty sandy but the moves are varied and interesting to the top out, which is sort of a sandy grovel up to some big jugs.# Location
First route on the left# Protection
5 bolts, two anchors w/ chains
