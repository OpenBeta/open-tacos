# Description
Start on the left most line of bolts at a large fragile looking flake.  Boulder a couple of moves to get off the ground, then a few easy moves lead to the business.  Follow sidepull flakes and edges to a short steep section at the top.  At the last bolt look to your right for the anchors, as it is easy to get suckered into going straight up.# Location
This is the left most route on the wall.# Protection
6 bolts
