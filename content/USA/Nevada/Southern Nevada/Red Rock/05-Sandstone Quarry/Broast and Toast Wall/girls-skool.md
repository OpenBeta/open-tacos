# Description
Girls Skool climbs a stretch of crunchy, low-density rock between CHUD and Desert Sportsman. If the rock was better, this route would be quite good, but as it is very few holds are solid. The grade may feel sandbagged (perhaps holds have broken since the FA).Begin on the huge, hollow flakes of CHUD then step right with difficulty to the line.# Location
# Protection
8 bolts to steel drop-ins. Consider stick clipping the second or third bolt as a fall from the traverse past the first bolt could result in a violent fall.
