# Description
This is a nice long route (by Red Rock standards), that has sustained 5.11 climbing the whole way.Scramble up to the first bolt, and then begin heading left toward the second bolt, where you have to go a bit of a distance hard left to the third bolt.  This part is a bit intimidating, but the moves are not too bad.  From here, head straight up the face where you will encounter a wide variety of climbing situations.  This is not your typical Red Rock crimpfest.# Location
This is the right most sport route on the upper tier of the Broast and Toast wall.# Protection
