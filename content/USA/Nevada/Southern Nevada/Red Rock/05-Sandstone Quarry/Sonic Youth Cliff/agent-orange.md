# Description
Climb the very crimpy face on vertical to slightly overhanging rock to a bad rest. The crux comes at about 3/4 of the way up and if that's not enough its still hard 11 after that and by then you're PUMPED. Long fall potential off the top if your too pumped to make the final moves to the anchor.# Location
3rd route from the right side of the cliff.# Protection
7 bolts, Chain anchor
