# Description
This is a pretty good route with a few cruxes. Low down There are some tough laybacks to start, and higher up, getting established above the bolted bulge. Both are 5.9-ish.Approach the climb via a heady scramble (no gear if roped) and set a belay at the base of a 6" thick right-facing flake. CLimb the flake to a ledge ~8 meters up, then climb on face holds past a few bolts at a featured bulge (crux). Finish the climb on gear and belay up top.# Location
N-most end of the Sonic Youth Cliff, on the upper tier. This is approached from the N/NE by an insecure scramble that a beginner should be roped for if they are to do it at all (still a nasty swing).To descend, we came back south quite far and hiked back N. to the base. There may be a shorter way.# Protection
A few draws for the bolts plus a rack of nuts and cams to 2". The bottom offers a belay stance that can be protected with some extra cams from .5" to 1", which is a good idea.
