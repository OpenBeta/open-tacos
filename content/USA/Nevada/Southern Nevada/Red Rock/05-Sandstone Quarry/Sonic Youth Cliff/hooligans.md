# Description
Broken holds. No chalk. Homemade hangers. Plenty of lichen, grit, and crumblies......but if you want to tick the crag, you have to do it!# Location
Leftmost on the Sonic Youth Wall.# Protection
First bolt has been replaced, the rest are homemade hangers - but they look good. Don't blow clip #2.
