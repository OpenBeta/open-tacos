# Description
This is an excellent route!  The namesake of the Sonic Youth cliff, this route climbs through a series of pockets and crimps on the lighter-colored rock just left of the waterstreak. The crux starts past the halfway point and continues through the top (endurance), which includes pulling a bulge on some small crimps. =)This is a "must do" if you visit this area of Sandstone Quarry!# Location
This route climbs the left side of the obvious water streak up the far right (west) side of the sonic youth cliff.# Protection
5 bolts to mussy hooks on the upper bulge.
