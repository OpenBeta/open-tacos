# Description
Just right of Crosshairs and much better. Scramble atop chossy ledge and reach real high to first bolt; be careful! Long moves and remarkably sustained climbing. Different character from the rest of the routes on the wall. Definitely worthy and good for the grade.# Location
# Protection
5 bolts
