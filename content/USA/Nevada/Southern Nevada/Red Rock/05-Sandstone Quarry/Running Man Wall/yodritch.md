# Description
This two pitch route climbs a bolted face and discontinuous cracks for two pitches.   Find the first pitch's first two bolts directly below a cracks splitting the wall down and below the wall where you find Red Heat.   Club up past 2 bolts and then follow a rightward trajectory clipping two more bolts before following a crack over a bulge to a belay anchor mid face.   The second pitch climbs a depression in the slab past one or two more bolts to the top anchor.# Location
Follow the trail past the base of Running Man and continue past the broken rock that leads up to Red Heat to the next wall.   The Climb begins just below an appearant crack that splits the upper wall.# Protection
We had a single rack of cams to #2 Camalot and many mid sized wires.   Offsets were very useful and there were some heady run outs on the easier terrain.
