# Description
A thin face climb on a near-vertical face. The left-most of a few adjacent face routes, it is the harder but the better protected. Climb past multiple thin moves on slopers to the anchor up top and lower off. It is a simple but fun route.# Location
This route is the left-most of the bolted routs to the left of Nevada Book and to the right of Split crack. This and 'Split Infinitive' both start from the top of a rounded ledge and near a nasty bush or two. Access their bases by fighting past a boulder in a funky gully below Nevada Book.# Protection
An handful of draws or slings for the bolts.
