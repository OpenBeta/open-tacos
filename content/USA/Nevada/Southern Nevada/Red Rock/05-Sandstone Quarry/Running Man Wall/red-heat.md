# Description
scramble up to the top of the gully to the right of running man. start up the left-leaning, right facing dihedrals (the set on the right) until you reach the bolt line. zig zag your way up the face to the anchor in the bigger of the two huge huecos at the top of the wall. Double ropes would have been nice to reduce drag. This is an awesome adventure sport route!!! All the bolts are 10 - 20 feet apart.  soft, sandy, slopey crimps on a steep slab.  could be harder than 10d at this point.# Location
right of running man up the gully on the west-facing wall.  this route takes the left angling ledge system to a line of 8 bolts up to the two huge huecos at the top of the wall.  the anchor is in the left hueco.# Protection
single rack to .75 camalot (maybe two .75s).  medium nuts. 8 bolts.  3 bolt anchor.
