# Description
Named after the Raiders' poor Superbowl showing, or the chess opening, this route climbs a tightly-bolted seam up the blunt arete/prow of that forms the right edge of the deep cleft that leads up to the Red Heat wall. Not pumpy - more about balance.Boulder up to the first bolt (bad landing). From there the route is tightly bolted and offers interesting climbing. Use care on a hollow undercling at mid-height. A soft touch for the given grade of 11c.# Location
# Protection
11 bolts. Bolted anchor.
