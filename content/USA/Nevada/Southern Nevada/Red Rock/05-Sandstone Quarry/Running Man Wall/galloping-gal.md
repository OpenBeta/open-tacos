# Description
A fun route up very good varnished rock. The crux comes in the vicinity of the third or fourth bolt. The easiest sequence wasn't initially obvious to me; using it might require some wingspan but there are several ways of doing the crux. The route stays interesting all the way to the top.# Location
This route can be found by first identifying the route Running Man. Go around the corner to the right a few feet and you'll see a dihedral with a wide crack/chimney in it. This route is just to the left of that wide crack. It's best to belay from a flat platform about 15 feet up that's an easy scramble to access; leading the route and lowering takes most of a 60m rope from that spot.# Protection
10 bolts to a two-bolt rappel anchor.
