# Description
This route is easier, but headier than its neighbor and is not the better warm-up. Climb crimps and slopers up the right-most of the bolted lines to reach an anchor. There are some distances between bolts that can be mitigated with gear, but not great gear.A poor choice for a beginner lead, if you have that in mind.# Location
This route is the right-most of the bolted routs to the left of Nevada Book and to the right of Split crack. This and 'Split Ends' both start from the top of a rounded ledge and near a nasty bush or two. Access their bases by fighting past a boulder in a funky gully below Nevada Book.# Protection
A handful of draws and a bad gear placement or two, maybe larger RP's in shallow cracks? I distinctly recall my partner laughing at my 1/2 buried brass HB micromate (a .33" cam) with 2 lobes in.
