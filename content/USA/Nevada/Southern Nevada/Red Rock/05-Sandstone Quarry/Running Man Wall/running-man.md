# Description
One of my favorite single-pitch climbs in the country, it is of a piece with other masculine enduro-classics such as Quarter of a Man and Mister Clean.  Features slightly overhanging Red Rocks crimping. Starts with a cruxy move by the first bolt (harder if short), followed by a long stretch of 5.10 climbing with no real rests and ends with a semi-cruxy move just below the anchors.The start of the climb is easy to find with the Swain guide.  This climb is in the sun almost the entire day.# Location
# Protection
This pitch has about 10 bolts, which some of us consider insufficient for a climb of this length, difficulty and continuousness.  The bolts can be easily supplemented with a few nuts in the #1-4 Rock range and a couple of cams in the narrow-to-rattly-finger range.  A #2.5 Friend is handy at the start.
