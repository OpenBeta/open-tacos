# Description
A so-so route that probably isnt worth doing with all the other awesome routes in the vicinity. If you do, make sure to take a medium cam (.5/.75 camalot) for between the 4th and 5th bolts- rock and bolt quality are both suspect.# Location
Located just right of Galloping Gal# Protection
6 bolts, one cam.
