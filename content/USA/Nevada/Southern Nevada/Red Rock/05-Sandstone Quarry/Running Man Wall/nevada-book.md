# Description
Nevada Book is a great climb, much in the same vein as Great Red Book, a route with which it shares a first ascensionist, John Williamson.The first pitch starts on top of the large boulder and goes up the easy, right-leaning ramp for about 60 feet to a fixed anchor (bolt, nut).The second pitch starts off with the crux immediately off the anchor. This chimney section is pretty poorly protected, but after a move or two, there is a bomber hold followed by some good pro. Continue up the mellow corner, past a tricky bulge, to the top of the feature where you build an anchor.Descend by walking to the left, down the Red Heat Gully. There is a single rope rappel from a bush.# Location
Nevada Book is located in the large left-facing corner about fifty feet to the right of the off-width route Split Crack. There are three bolted face climbs immediately to the left of Nevada Book.Approach as per Running Man Wall: from Sandstone Quarry parking lot, follow a trail south-east next to the road until a path drops down into a gully past a mushroom-shaped boulder. Climb a water trough past numerous tanks up to a giant ledge and follow this contour south past the Boschton Marathon Block. Nevada Book is on the far right side of the Running Man formations.# Protection
We used up to a #4 C4 Camalot. The runout may be mitigated with a #6 Camalot or a #4 Big Bro.
