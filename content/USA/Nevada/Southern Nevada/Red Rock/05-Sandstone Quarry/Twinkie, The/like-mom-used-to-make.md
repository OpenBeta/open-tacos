# Description
This is a fantastic pitch of vertical, technical climbing on creamy white rock. Big reaches between incut crimps leads to a difficult (to read and execute) top out on slopers.A worthy candidate for a rebolt.# Location
The center route on the Twinkie.# Protection
4x bolts and a couple pieces. The bolts are of questionable integrity.More specifically:I'd recommend stick-clipping the first bolt.Blue and Green Aliens, or similar, in a horizontal protect some committing moves to the second bolt.A #6 BD Stopper (I think) could back up the third bolt.The anchor has no hardware for lowering (just bolts/hangers). I left a piece of my dog's leash and a single carabiner in January 2020, but I'd definitely bring something else if I did it again. Perhaps there is a walk-off?
