# Description
The furthest left route on the wall, on the arete left of Strategic Arms. Start on the arete proper, and at the second bolt transition onto the steep left face. Make a long thin move to gain bolt three, and then fight the pump for three move bolts, saving enough for the thin redpoint crux at the last bolt. Great rock. Cool climb.The thirty feet below the shelf can be toproped at 5.10.# Location
# Protection
Six bolts to anchors.
