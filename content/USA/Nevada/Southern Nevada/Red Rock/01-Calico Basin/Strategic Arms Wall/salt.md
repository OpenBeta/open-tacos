# Description
Start 20 feet right of Disarmament, under a squeeze chimney. Climb the chimney with many face holds around it. At the third bolt, where the line splits, take the left bolt line (going straight up) and fight your way up and over a bulge with poor feet. Climb the slab above, and when the wall steepens, use opposing flakes and specific feet to gain an angling flake of jugs. Up in the varnish, follow the line up and slightly left, finally arriving at the high anchor. A long technical route.# Location
