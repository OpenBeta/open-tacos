# Description
Starts forty feet right of Strategic Arms. Follow a thin, left facing corner for three bolts, and make a move up and over the bulge. Traverse left into a juggy flake, and then balance your way up the slab above. Upon arriving at the first seam, the wall steepens and the holds start to vanish. A long stab off of bad crimps and poor feet brings you to bolt number 10, but the action doesn't stop there! You've gained a massive horizontal, but no feet forces you into one of two desperate sequences. Anorexicly thin climbing through the higher wispy seam brings you to the last bolt, where (finally!) some good holds bring you to the chains. Extremely technical.# Location
