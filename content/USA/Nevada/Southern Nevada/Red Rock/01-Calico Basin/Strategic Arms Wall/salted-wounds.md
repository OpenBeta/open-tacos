# Description
Start as for SALT, but where the line splits, follow the line to the right, traversing through a section of thin crimps before gaining a good rail. Follow the line diagonally across the wall, following a large break, eventually working your way straight up through a large set of black varnish plates (some of which are a little hollow). One tricky move above the last bolt guards the chains. A short crux in a long enjoyable climb.# Location
# Protection
12 bolts to chains.
