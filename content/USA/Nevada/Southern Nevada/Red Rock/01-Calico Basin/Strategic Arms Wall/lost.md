# Description
The start for Lost and Found are just to the left of a large boulder choking the canyon. Climb up to a large crumbly hueco. From here the two climbs split with Lost going left and Found going right. Both are great and have different styles.For Found, climb out of the hueco and power through a blocky roof, to a left facing thin corner. Climb the corner to a small ledge to de-pump. Climb the exposed headwall above to find the anchor. Great route.# Location
