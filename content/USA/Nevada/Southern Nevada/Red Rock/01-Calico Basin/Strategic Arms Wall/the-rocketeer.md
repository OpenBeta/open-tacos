# Description
This climb has good movement through 2 separate crux sections.  Good rests are had, but the second crux you'll want to fire through using good footwork.Requires 70m rope.The rock is currently fragile.  Numerous thin flakes on the route that have the potential to break.  Small pebbles can rain down.  The line is to the right of the belay spot, so most rockfall will land away from the belayer.  Be careful where you step and what you pull on.  I broke off a baseball sized chunk in the first half of the climb.Shares anchor with Red Planet.# Location
On the left face of Strategic Arms Wall.  Once arriving at the wall from the gully, head up and left.Bolt line to the right of the clean red streak up the wall.  The red streak also has a bolt line for Red Planet.  Begins atop the landing with a twisted tree at the base.# Protection
