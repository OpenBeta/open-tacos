# Description
The start for Lost and Found are just to the left of a large boulder choking the canyon. Climb up to a large crumbly hueco. From here the two climbs split with Lost going left and Found going right. Both are great and have different styles. For Lost climb out of the hueco and pull a small bulge. Continue straight up the face using friendly pockets, huecos, and edges to a obvious slab crux. Float through the crux and continue to an anchor above the roof.# Location
