# Description
A really fun line that climbs straight up the face.  The climb is deceiving; where it looks easy, it isn't as easy as it looks. Where it looks hard, it isn't as hard as it looks.  Say no more - we'll ruin the fun.  Get on it and enjoy, the clipping stances are great!  A great place to take pics of folks on CYT or leading this climb or Mark Limage's November Daze just to the west of this line. We really struggled with this being 5.8 or 5.9, please let us know what you think!# Location
About 40 feet west of the left edge of CYT.  This climb and November Daze go up the same face.# Protection
8 bolts to a great ledge and chains.
