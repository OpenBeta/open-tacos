# Description
A fun line straight up the face.  This TR can be established either from Interproximal Stripper (to the left), or by ascending the gully further to the left (West) of CYT.  After ascending the gully approximately 40 continue right, up the back side of the main formation.  Then set up a TR on Braces and Bridges and rappel or walk (scary) to these anchors.  Please establish all TR lines with draws.  TRing directly off the chains or rings will wear through the metal quicker then we could drill your bicuspid with a 24v Bosch!# Location
