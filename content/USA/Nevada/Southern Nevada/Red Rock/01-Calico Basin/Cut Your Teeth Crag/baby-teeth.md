# Description
A short, easily protected trad line for the beginning trad leader.   Follow the right-leaning crack to a comfy ledge.  Look down and east on this for some exciting exposure!  Walk off right with one very exposed, but easy move.   Go down a little to an easy walk to the left where you can access the chains on Braces and Bridges or walk off the approach gully - scary.  If set up a TR on this line, please be sure to equalize your anchors!# Location
# Protection
A set of nuts, a couple of medium cams and hexes evenly spaced in this feature get you safely to the top.
