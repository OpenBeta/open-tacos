# Description
Seven bolts to anchors.  This climb ascends the left-most edge of CYT and can be used to access the chains of Laughing Gas and Braces and Bridges to establish three TR routes.  Just when you think its not 5.7, check your feet - now, rinse and spit.   Youll have to use draws to establish a TR on this one.# Location
See the attached topo, but this is the left most (west)route on CYT.# Protection
Seven bolts to anchors.  All hardware is painted black.
