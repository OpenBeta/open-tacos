# Description
A longer and relatively easy climb.  A little bit of everything here-- a small layback at the start, a crack climb in the middle and a small chimney at the top.# Location
The top rope bolts are located 180 degrees behind the start of Interproximal Stripper.  On your way up to CYT look for the small cave half way up the wall, the route is to the left.  The top of Head Gear is the starting location for all of the CYT climbs.# Protection
Two fixed bolts at the base of cut your teeth crag, no chains
