# Description
A 5.8 start gets easier as you get higher! The main TR line on the crag.  This climb ascends just to the left of the crack that splits CYT in two sections and can be established either from Interpoximal Stripper (with a run-out over easy slab), or by ascending the gully to the left (West) of CYT.  After ascending the gully approximately 40Â’ continue right, up the back side of the main formation.    Rappelling on these anchors provides easy access to Laughing Gas and Interproximal Stripper.     Please TR on draws.# Location
