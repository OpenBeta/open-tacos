# Description
A lot of fun to do if you want to climb harder while there, top rope hero style.Overhung, with jugs and even crimpy jugs galore.The semi-roof ending is the crux, as it turns over the face the huecos disappear and a few balanced, strong crimps get to the top.# Location
Around the corner from September Knights, up the small side canyon.# Protection
Two bolted chains on a quicklink are above the climb. You can TR it by traversing 15 easy feet from September Knights or by rapping 15 feet from another set of bolted anchors approachable by scrambling up the side canyon
