# Description
A vertical dike feature becomes a crack up higher where two sections of cliff meet. There is frail, fragile rock on the right-hand cliff section forming a mini elephant trunk that probably wont be there for long. Climb up the dike and over the bulge (hard .10/11 move) and continue up the easy slab above. Stay on the right side of the slabby face above the bulge for the easiest line up to the anchors. Most of the climb is 5.8/9 except the one hard move over the bulge.# Location
Located on the right-hand side of the crag, about 40-50ft to the right of the box chimney (Double Decker Couch).# Protection
Ring anchors at top.
