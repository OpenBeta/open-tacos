# Description
Start up on the left side of the ledge below the big, left-facing corner. There are two swooping, curving, body-size scoops in the rock. Vitruvius climbs through these onto a angled ledge and up right to the anchors. Crux is some tricky moves between first and second bolt (can go right and cut back left, or straight up with similar difficulty either way).# Location
First route about 8ft to the left of the big, left-facing corner. See topo photo.# Protection
7 bolts, ring anchors.
