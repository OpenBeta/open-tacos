# Description
An awesome box chimney with cracks, face holds, stemming, and chimneying. Good gear in the cracks all the way. Near the top the chimney narrows to a squeeze. Face climb on the right to the anchors. Watch for the rope getting sucked into the crack on lower and when TRing.# Location
Locate the big, left-facing corner and steep face making up it's right side. 35ft to the right past a steep, overhanging bouldering wall is a box chimney with cracks in its back corners. This is the Double Decker Couch.# Protection
Finger and hand size gear, ring anchors at the top.
