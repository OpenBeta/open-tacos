# Description
A "scary" crack with "spooky" features.This wide looking crack is situated in the center of Dickies Cliff. Start right of the crack on some huge huecos, take a left at the empty skull about 15 feet up, jam and face climb to the main crack. Stay in the main crack, and you'll finish with fun moves as you pass a black hall to nowhere. "Beyond it is another dimension: a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into... the Twilight Zone."If climbed on Halloween, this climb deserves 3 stars; any other time of the year 1 to 2 stars.Descent: Rappel from the bolted anchor. If the anchor goes missing, head right/west and 4th class down the gullies on the right side of the cliff; the third narrow gully on climbers right seemed easiest, but be careful.# Location
