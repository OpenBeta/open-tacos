# Description
A bulge crux leads to pumpy terrain.This classic crack is on the right side of Dickies Cliff.  Head up easy terrain to a steep crack with an initial roof.  Throw in some pro and some jams to negotiate the roof.  Above the roof you will find a steep crack with good pro, good jams, and good edges.  Near the top the climbing eases off.  I think this climb is about 80 feet high.Descent:  Head right / west and 4th class down the gullies on the right side of the cliff.  The third narrow gully on climbers right seemed easiest, but be careful.# Location
# Protection
Standard rack to #4 Camalot.  A #4 is perfect for protecting the roof.  Use medium cams for the anchor (no bolt anchor).
