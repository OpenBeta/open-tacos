# Description
Nirvana is a great route and tests your power endurance.  Begin on the right side and commit up the slab and crack to the first bolt.  From here go up and over the bulge to the arÃªte/face with a wild dynamic move to gain a descent hold.  Traverse leftward with few feet and a hard pocket move to gain the left side of the wall.  Shake out and go back right on a pumping rail and hopefully not a heart breaker finish move.# Location
This route starts on the right, traverses left through the center of the wall, and then punches back right.# Protection
