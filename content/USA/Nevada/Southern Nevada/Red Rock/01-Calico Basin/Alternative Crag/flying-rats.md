# Description
A definitive crux on this one, paired with enjoyable and technical climbing, makes for a fun and challenging route.  Definitely a couple notches more difficult than Paralyzed, with wich it shares the arete start.# Location
Flying Rats shares the first three bolts of Paralyzed, continuing straight up - just right of the arete - after the third bolt.# Protection
6 bolts, 2 bolt anchor
