# Description
Another route with a crux at the start but this route is pretty fun too!  Make sure you get good gear in before the roof moves into the thin crack.  There is some slight run-out on the face above but just look for some good horizontal placements.  Good Route!!# Location
This fun route is about 20 feet to the right of "Aliens Have Landed" at a right-facing corner under a small overhand.  Pull the overhand and follow this crack and face to the top and use standard walk off descent!# Protection
Trad rack with an emphasis on some THIN gear; especially some brass nuts and lowe balls.  There is NO fixed gear so take some large cams for the anchor on top.  There are some fragile holds so use caution and climb soft!
