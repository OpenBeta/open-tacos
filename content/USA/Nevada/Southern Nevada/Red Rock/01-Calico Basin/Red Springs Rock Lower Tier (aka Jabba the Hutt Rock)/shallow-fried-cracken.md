# Description
This is the very obvious thin crack going up through the dead center of this section of the crag.  The crux is half way up the route on some thin finger jams and face holds.  Good route but somewhat serious lead as gear can get thin and its sometimes hard to see your placements and some of the rock might be suspect.  Climb with soft sandstone technique and get extra placements in wherever possible.  Fun!# Location
Climb the obvious thin crack up the center of this face; the route has a basketball sized hueco just barely to the right of the crack about 10 feet off the ground.# Protection
Trad lead with an emphasis on small pieces (ballnuts, thin cams, brass wires, etc).  There are no bolts but sometimes there are slings on the tree at cliff top for rappeling.  Walk off is a pretty easy option too; just walk off as "Aliens Have Landed".
