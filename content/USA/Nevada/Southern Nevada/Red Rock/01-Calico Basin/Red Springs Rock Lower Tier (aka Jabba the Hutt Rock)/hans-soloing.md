# Description
This would only be used as a good warm up or possibly for a new trad climber looking for some really easy terrain.  There really is no crux.  This route is a good climb to set up a top rope for the fun crack "Aliens Have Landed".# Location
Climb the LOW-angled ramp about 15-20 feet left of the obvious vertical crack on the face.  Descent requires walk off and you should take the second gully left (south) from the top of the formation.  Easy Descent!# Protection
Take a small trad rack up to about 2 inches plus up to 3.5 for the anchors on top.  NOTE:  Brock/McMIllan guidebook lists this route as a top rope; you CAN definitely get some solid placements -- just use some common sense and don't place your cam in some cat-litter-quality rock!!
