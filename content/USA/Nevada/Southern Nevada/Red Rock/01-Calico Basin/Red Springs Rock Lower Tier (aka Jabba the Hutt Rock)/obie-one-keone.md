# Description
This route is a top-rope only climb with one thin move to start then climbing some crappy fragile rock to the cliff top.  Don't go out of your way for this climb; just maybe climb after climbing the 5.9 crack (Shallow Fried Cracken).  The "R" or "X" rating would ONLY be if leading this route; which...I would NOT recommend!# Location
This route starts on top of a left angling ramp about 15-20 feet off the ground.  This climb is located about 100 feet right of "Carrie Fissure" and 20 feet left of the obvious thin crack "Shallow Fried Cracken".  Start on this face with friction feet and follow left facing scope feature through crappy rock then face climb to the top.# Protection
Leading this route would be "X" rated and not recommended.  This route has some crappy rock and bad and/or no placements.  TOP ROPE ONLY!  Use the trees on top for your anchor and back up with some gear.  You can either walk off or sometimes there is some rappel slings.
