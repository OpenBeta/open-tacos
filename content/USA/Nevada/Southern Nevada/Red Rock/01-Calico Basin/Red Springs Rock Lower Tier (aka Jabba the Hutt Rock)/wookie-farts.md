# Description
Slightly awkward and off-width-y start, a cruise up a nice corner and then a short traverse to the anchors of "Carrie Fissure" for the finish. Mostly fingers and face holds. Just before the crack starts to fizzle out, but while still below them, traverse to the Anchors of "Carrie Fissure." The crux is definitely the beginning. The face of the semi-detached pillar could possibly be easier, but gear doesn't look as good. Not a bad little climb. A good step-up for a trad leader who is solid at the 5.7 grade.# Location
Crack system immediately right of "Carrie Fissure."# Protection
A #4 camelot protects the beginning moves nicely. After that, standard rack to 2".
