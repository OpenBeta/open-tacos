# Description
Pretty fun route with a thin and difficult crux right at the start.  The start might be difficult to protect on lead so be careful.  After the initial thin section; great and varied FUN finger crack to practice finger jams the rest of the way to the juggy roof move at top!# Location
This route is the obvious vertical crack with a small roof about 10 feet up.  Take the walk off the same as Hans Soloing!# Protection
If leading; take THIN gear up to 2 inches plus larger cams for an anchor on top.  Recommend climbing Hans Soloing and setting up a top rope if not confident at the grade??  Also watch for some thin and fragile holds at the start.
