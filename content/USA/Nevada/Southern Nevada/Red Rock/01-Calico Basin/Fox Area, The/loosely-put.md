# Description
An awkward start leads to a right-facing corner which is loose-ly followed to the top of the formation via a right-trending crack. Belay slightly around a corner at a small, flat area.# Location
Begin in a narrow corridor slightly uphill and to the right of The Fox area that can be used to access Fox Hunt, and as a descent for Fat and Hungry.# Protection
