# Description
The right route. Climb delicately up to a roof and hand traverse the loose, wide crack to where it turns the corner. Jam the offwidth with liberal use of Thank God (unless they break) face holds for hands and feet. There is solid, varnished rock inside the offwidth so protection is bomber. After about 40 feet the angle eases considerably along with the difficulties. Belay atop the rock at a large, flat area. Save a couple small to medium-sized pieces and a long sling or cordelette for the anchor.# Location
About 200 feet below and several hundred feet right of The Fox is a bulbous, mushroom feature with a giant roof. On the left side of this rock is a pleasant-looking low-angled hand crack. On the right side is an ominous, overhanging and loose-looking wide crack.# Protection
