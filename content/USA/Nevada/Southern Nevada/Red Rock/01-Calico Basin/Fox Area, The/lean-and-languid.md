# Description
Belay atop an easy slab at the base of the crack. Romp up moderate but loose rock to gain the corner crack. Fragile face holds appear where the hand crack widens, which keep the grade mellow. Round the corner and frolic to the top of the crack. Belay from cams.# Location
About 200 feet below and several hundred feet right of The Fox is a bulbous, mushroom feature with a giant roof. On the left side of this rock is a pleasant-looking low-angled hand crack. On the right side is an ominous, overhanging and loose-looking wide crack.# Protection
