# Description
This is the first recorded ascent (as far as we can tell), though the first pitch appears to have been climbed before (there's an old, fixed hex at the logical belay spot). It's of course possible that the second pitch has been climbed as well, but the extremely fragile rock  made it seem that it had not been touched previously.In any case it's well worth doing since it's adjacent to The Fox.P1: Follow the arching splitter 20 feet right of The Fox and belay at the base of the large, left-facing corner. 60 feet, 5.7.P2: Grovel up some loose rock to the short, overhanging fist and off-width crack. Struggle up this, then top out via a lower-angled wide crack and belay above. 60 feet, 5.10d.# Location
