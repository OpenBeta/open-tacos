# Description
This is a very clean right facing corner a few hundred feet above the desert floor. It is a fantastic pitch on perfect desert varnish.Start directly below the dihedral and follow discontinuous holds and finger locks 20' up to the dihedral proper. From here, climb the nice jam crack, gradually widening from thin hands to an offwidth section about 70' up the corner. A #4 camalot is mandatory for this section, two would be nice. Bring a #5 if you have one. After a few secure wide crack moves (some face holds are helpful here too), you will surmount a slight bulge and continue up a low angle 5" crack to the top. The descent is easy and obvious.# Location
