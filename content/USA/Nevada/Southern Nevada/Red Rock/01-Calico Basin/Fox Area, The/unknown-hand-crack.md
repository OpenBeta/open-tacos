# Description
This is a slightly left leaning hand to hand+ crack that sits up on top of an easy to scramble up ledge.The crack itself is solid black varnish offering good protection but outside the crack is mostly lighter, softer, sandy, breakable rock.This route is a fun jaunt if you’ve just done The Fox around the corner and is worth a look on the walk off.# Location
Left of The Fox around the corner and uphill about 50 feet. As you do the walk off from The Fox, you will first see the bolted anchor with quick links on a ledge on the wall to your left as you’re facing down hill.# Protection
Camalot #1-4 and bolted anchor
