# Description
This route has a couple good moves but is lacking a distinct crux.  Pro is somewhat mossy so be careful.  This route is worth doing once while in the area getting the other routes ticked off.  NOTICE:  This route and Fontanar's descriptions and length in the Brock/McMillan guidebood are off; routes are at around 180 feet in length!# Location
This route shares the same start as Fontanar; but after about 15 feet on the pillar; traverse right on big holds to the obvious thin crack.  Follow this crack up to the chimney; climb through the chimney and up the face to build your anchor.# Protection
Trad rack only with more of the small to medium sized wires and cams.  Be a little careful; the varnished crack down low is a little mossy; make sure your placements are good.  Up high, there is some friable rock so climb softly.  No anchors; just walk off like you would on Fontanar de Rojo.
