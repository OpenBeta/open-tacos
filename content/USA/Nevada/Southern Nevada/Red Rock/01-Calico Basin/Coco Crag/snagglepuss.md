# Description
A really enjoyable new line somehow overlooked for many years til now. Follows an engaging line of features up perfect varnish with several reachy moves to a mellow, featured slab finish. A pretty classic set of moves in my book. This route was bolted ground up without hooks with no toprope previewing and no chalk. One of our party was putting in his first bolts on lead up there on a 5.11-not too shabby! We spotted this line while replacing the outdated open shuts on the neighboring routes with mussies and stainless bolts courtesy the ASCA.# Location
Between the two established 5.10s following seams and huecos up to the beautiful varnished panel and above.# Protection
All stainless bolts and hardware. Fixe rings up top for rappel.
