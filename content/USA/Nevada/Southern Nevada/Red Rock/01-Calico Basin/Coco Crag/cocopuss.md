# Description
This is an EXCELLENT sport route on the left side of the Coco Crag about 3 feet right of the obvious chimney.  Varied movements; great protection; and climbing that is much steeper than it appears from the ground; as good as any sport route in Red Rocks at the grade IMHO.  Brock guidebook says 10b but it might be 10a'ish??# Location
This is the first obvious bolted line just right of the chimney.  Rappel from the anchors with one 60 meter rope; a 50 might make it too??# Protection
8 Bolts lead to some anchors on the slab above.  The route is well protected and climbs great.
