# Description
This route follows different crack systems to the top of the cliff.  Ascend the right facing flake to the top of the pillar; then follow the obvious varnished corner (crux??) to its top; and then follow the left angling wide flare to the top (some thin gear).  Crux would be the obvious varnished corner; but it looks more intimidating then it is; the jams are SUPER secure.  The crux is great (2 Stars) while the rest would only be 1 star.# Location
This route is 15 feet to the right of Stupid Cat at the obvious pillar feature.  At the top, I recommend walking off as per Classic Corner of Calico since you'll be right on top of it.# Protection
Bring a selection of gear including some thin crack pieces for the start and also the top.  No anchors so walk off right or left.
