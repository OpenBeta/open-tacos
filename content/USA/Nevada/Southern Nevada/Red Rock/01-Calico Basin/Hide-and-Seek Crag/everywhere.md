# Description
All the way on the left of the cliff, there is a right facing corner/crack that starts over some easy slab and goes up the crack/corner to a set of bolted anchors with chains.# Location
You can access the anchors by doing some easy and safe scrambling up the right side of this crag - behind and to the right of the boulder at the start of the other two routes.After going up right, you trend left over some easy boulders to a slabby face and up.  Once at the top of this area, you will see a large "standing"  boulder if you walk until it is right on your right side and then turn 90 degrees left you can walk to the top of "Everywhere."  There is one rap-in bolt (it is hidden by a small feature in the rock so you may have to search it out) and you can set up the TR pretty easily.# Protection
It takes gear but the quality of the rock for the gear is questionable so we have left it as a top rope.
