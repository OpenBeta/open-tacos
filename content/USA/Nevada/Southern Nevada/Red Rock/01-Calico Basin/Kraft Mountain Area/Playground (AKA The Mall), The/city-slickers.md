# Description
Start in the tunnel to the left of the formation and chimney up to a good 0.5 Camalot placement. Swing wildly onto the face, clip a bolt, and do some powerful moves to access the crack. This can be followed to an anchor at the top of the wall.# Location
The left-most route on the upper tier of the Mall.# Protection
0.5 Camalot, #4 Camalot, and a full set of wires.The anchor is really bad and should be replaced. If you’re not up for the task some cord and a ‘biner would back up the sketchy rusty chain.
