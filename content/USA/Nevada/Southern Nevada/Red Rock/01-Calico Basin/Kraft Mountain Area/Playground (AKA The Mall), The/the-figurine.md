# Description
This route was fun, but a little dirty.  I kept breaking off foot holds.  With some more traffic it would get a star or two.The crux is the first 20 feet of OW and the protection is good.  The rest of the climb is easier chimney, with adequate protection.# Location
Pretty easy to find.  Just walk around right from Electric Orange Peeler for about 200 feet.  There is an hourglass flake on the right edge of the climb, about 20 feet up.# Protection
For pro I brought double C4 #3, #4, and one #5, plus an old camalot 3.5, old 4, old 5.  Didn't need anything bigger, and only used about half of what I brought.Sling a block at the top with a double runner.
