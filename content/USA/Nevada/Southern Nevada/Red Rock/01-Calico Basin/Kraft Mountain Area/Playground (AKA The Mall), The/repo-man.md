# Description
PG rating on this one. It's delicate and technical getting to the second bolt. If you come off here you're going to swing back into the ledge. I believe some of the holds have broken since the first ascent as it felt considerably harder than 11a.# Location
On the middle tier the black varnished face. You can recognize the route by the second bolt diagonaling out left.# Protection
