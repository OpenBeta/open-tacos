# Description
Lick it starts with an enjoyable 5.8 crack. From the top of the crack 3 bolts and 5.11 climbing will get you to the anchor.Climb a nice tight-hands crack in varnished rock, the step right and clip the first of four widely-spaced bolts. The upper headwall is steep, exposed, and requires a bit of commitment. Easier than the route to the left (contrary to guidebook rating), but perhaps a bit more sustained. A fun route!# Location
This nice climb is on the lower cliff band just right of the break described in the directions.# Protection
Medium size cams for the crack and 3 bolts plust bolted anchor.
