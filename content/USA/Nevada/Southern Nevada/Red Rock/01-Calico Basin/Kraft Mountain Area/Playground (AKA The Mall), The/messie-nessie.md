# Description
This route was quite good. Sustained technical crimping.A gymnastic and bouldery route up the steep face to the right of Dirty Little Girl. The pockets down low tempt you into thinking this one might not be too bad- and it isn't, assuming you can sort the beta quickly and efficiently.I would recommend pre-hanging the first two draws and stick-clipping the first on this one to keep your ankles intact if you biff the opening boulder problem. Don't worry- it's not the crux!# Location
Just to the left of Repo Man. The right side of the sunny face. Immediately right of Dirty Little Girl. A few pockets on a smoothish face with bolts is route route. Can easily be TR'd after climbing DLG.# Protection
