# Description
You can either sart in the same crack as Lick It and then traverse around to the first bolt or you can start in the crack directly below. The direct start is slightly harder. Although this one is bolted it shouldn't be consdered a sport climb. The bolts are pretty sporty and the rock is very chossy. The only reason to do this one is if you just need to make a check mark in the book. (That's why I did it).# Location
10' right of Lick It.# Protection
medium cams for the crack and three bolts.
