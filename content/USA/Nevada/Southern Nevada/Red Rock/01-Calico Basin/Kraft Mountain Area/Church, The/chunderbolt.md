# Description
There is a crux midway up with an awkward body positioning. this may feel better after the route is cleaned up. The headwall is difficult to pull into with a desperate move to get established.# Location
This is the lone sport line on the crag and climbs a very featured crack. The route start is on great huecos.# Protection
10 bolts to bolt anchor.
