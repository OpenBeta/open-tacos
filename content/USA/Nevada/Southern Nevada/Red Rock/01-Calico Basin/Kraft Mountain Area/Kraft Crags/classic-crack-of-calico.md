# Description
A fun climb that starts crumbly but becomes more classic with height. Good variety of climbing with some nice cracks, corners, and face climbing.Pitch 1: Scramble up the gully to reach the left facing corner. Climb the corner with help from a series of cracks out left with occasional face holds. Move left under a roof and over easier ground below a varnished roof with a wide crack. 150'Pitch 2: Pull the wide roof and follow up a nice right facing corner to a large ledge. 50'Pitch 3: Move the belay down and right slightly and climb a long left facing corner with a series of cracks and some face holds on fairly vertical stone. Eventually it will ledge out and build a belay where you see fit 120'Descent: Hike a bit further up Kraft Mountain and then cut right (East) and traverse the hillside until you reach the "2nd gully" and take this down following cairns. At a certain point you leave the gulley and head right (West) traversing the hillside to the base of the route.# Location
