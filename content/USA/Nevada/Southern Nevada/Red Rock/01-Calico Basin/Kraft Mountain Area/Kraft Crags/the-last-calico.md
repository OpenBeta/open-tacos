# Description
Furthest route to climbers right.  This great looking line climbs a series of of right-leaning cracks.  Expect to encounter everything from finger crack to off width on this sustained and entertaining line.  Many minor variations can be done depending on exactly which crack you decide to follow and when.After topping out and bringing up the second, there is still about 60 feet of scrambling on easier class 4 ground before reaching the descent ridge/trail.  Once on this ridge head right and look for cairns.# Location
200' right and slightly higher than Classic Crack of Calico# Protection
Single rack to 5", double 2"-4"
