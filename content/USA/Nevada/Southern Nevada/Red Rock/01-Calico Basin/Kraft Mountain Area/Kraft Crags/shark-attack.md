# Description
Shark Attack goes up, under, and inside the huge roof on Kraft Mountain. This route is a unique outing with a short approach.Pitch 1 - 60' Start near a slight dihedral and carefully continue up questionable rock. Gain a short crack and pull up and over it to reach a pretty good stance. Belay here.Pitch 2 - 55' Continue up the corner crack until you find yourself inside the huge traversing chimney squeeze (good rock). From here, ask yourself what you're doing and commit to getting up inside the jaws of the shark. Lots of squeeze techniques and winging needed. Once negotiating the traverse you gain a left facing corner, where you can smear. Exit out through a small slot headfirst. Belay a few feet higher off a slung block and micro nuts/small cam.Pitch 3 - 40' Continue upwards for walk off ledge or rappel from P2 slung anchor.# Location
The largest roof on a band of pinkish rock on the South side of Kraft Mtn.  Between High Roller and Shark Vegas.# Protection
