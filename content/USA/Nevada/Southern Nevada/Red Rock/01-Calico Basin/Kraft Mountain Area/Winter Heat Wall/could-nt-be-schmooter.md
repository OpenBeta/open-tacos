# Description
Good route left of Winter Heat. Fun climbing up dark varnished rock. Plenty of protection options to satisfy all your safety needs.History: According to Wendall Broussard aka “The Dean of Red Rock,” both “Couldn’t be Schmooter“ and “High Class Ho” are both named after a French craps dealer that worked at Caesar's Palace in the 1980’s. After the deal, he would mutter to Wendall in a heavy French accent “Couldn’t be Schmooter!“ Unfortunately the Frenchman could neither deal smoothly nor pronounce the word smooth. One day Wendall and Paul VB were exploring beyond Kraft mountain when they ran into an old friend Randall Grandstaff. Grandstaff known for tall tales, asked Wendall what they were doing so far back; “We’re looking for routes”  Wendall said, “well there are none back there” said Grandstaff. Wendall and Paul both looked at each other and knew that they about to strike gold.# Location
