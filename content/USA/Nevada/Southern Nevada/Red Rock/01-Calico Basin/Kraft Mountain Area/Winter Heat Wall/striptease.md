# Description
Striptease is a fantastic pitch that scales a gently overhanging panel of cracked varnish on the right side of the Winter Heat Wall.Begin at the top of the ramp on a finger crack shared with High Class Ho. Some gear will get you to the first bolt, then pull the roof and prepare thyself for battle - a building pump leads to the top of the wall. The anchor is set back from the edge (cordelette useful?) and although the business end of this rig sports 8 bolts you may wish for a small cam to protect the cruxy moves between bolts one and two.Great climbing that is only docked a star because of a few brittle holds.# Location
# Protection
8x draws and some finger-sized gear.
