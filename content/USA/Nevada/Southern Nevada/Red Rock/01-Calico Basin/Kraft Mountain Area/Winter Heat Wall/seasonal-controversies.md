# Description
A good (and powerful) route just to the right of Winter Heat. Start below two bolts that sit right of Winter Heat. Work your way up the wall, following the features above the bolts, aiming for a slot of white rock where another bolt waits for you. Finish at the Winter Heat anchor.# Location
Just to the right of Winter Heat. Descend by rappelling off of that anchor.# Protection
A good selection of gear to 3"
