# Description
A decent little two pitch route that climbs the slabby face on the right side of Winter Heat Wall. Good practice for building anchors.P1) 5.3. 120'. Start in some bushes below a slabby crack (look for a hollow flake about 15' up). Climb ~20' to a small ledge and continue through a slight off-width to a larger ledge (be mindful of rope drag in this section). Follow the obvious crack/ramp left to a right-facing corner. Build an anchor here (small cams and nuts).P2) 5.7. 70' Stay slightly right of the corner on cracks and sandy edges, climbing up to/past a small overhang. Step back into the corner, above the overhang, and follow the corner to the top. (1"-2" cams for anchor).Descent: From the top of P2, traverse left (east) along the ledge and rap off the fixed anchors at the top ofWinter Heat(first anchors you come across). You can additionally rap off the tree at the top ofA-OK(far left side of wall).# Location
Far right side of Winter Heat Wall, center of the large slabby face.# Protection
Standard rack (including nuts) to 3". Gear anchors.
