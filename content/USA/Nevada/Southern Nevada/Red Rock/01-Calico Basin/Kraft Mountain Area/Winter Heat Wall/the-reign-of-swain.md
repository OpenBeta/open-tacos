# Description
A thin and devious route that is probably a bit of a sandbag at 5.10d. Start left of the obvious chimney on the left side of the wall. There are two routes on this wall- this is the leftmost route. Follow the bolts up and left through a roof, clip a bolt and then make the run (20') to the anchors.# Location
Leftmost route on the wall, open shut/clip in anchor.# Protection
7 bolts
