# Description
Fantastic route up beautiful chocolate colored rock. Follow the thin seam up the center of the wall to a large scoop. Place your pro fast to avoid burning out. Super fun and well worth a visit. Good protection for the entire length of the route, but place it when you can.# Location
The center most seam/crack on the Winter Heat Wall.# Protection
Standard rack to 1". Especially wires. Also cams to 4" for the pockets down low to feel super comfortable.
