Follow a beautiful short thin hands then over a roof (left side) up black polished ramp (small aliens or brassies needed) Shares same anchor as Winter Heat.History: According to Wendall Broussard aka “The Dean of Red Rock,” both “Couldn’t be Schmooter“ and “High Class Ho” are both named after a French craps dealer that worked at Caesar's Palace in the 1980’s. When pretty women would walk by he would mutter to Wendell in a heavy french accent, “Now that’s a High Class Ho.” One day Wendall and Paul VB were exploring beyond Kraft mountain when they ran into an old friend Randall Grandstaff. Grandstaff known for tall tales, asked Wendall what they were doing so far back; “We’re looking for routes”  Wendall said, “well there are none back there” said Grandstaff. Wendall and Paul both looked at each other and knew that they about to strike gold.# Location
