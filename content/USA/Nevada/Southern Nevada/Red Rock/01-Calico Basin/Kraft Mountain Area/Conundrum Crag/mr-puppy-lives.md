# Description
Two crux sections with one half way up requiring good feet and a long left throw from a right handed crimp. Second crux being 3/4 way up requiring a long right handed throw which lets you either bump off a gaston to the small right hand crimp or go straight for it. All of the holds are bomber with nothing flexing as long as you stay on route nothing should shed for some time.# Location
20 ft right of drilling miss daisy with the start at the base of the ramp or you could cheat it and walk up the ramp to the first bolt.# Protection
5 bolts to open/shut anchors
