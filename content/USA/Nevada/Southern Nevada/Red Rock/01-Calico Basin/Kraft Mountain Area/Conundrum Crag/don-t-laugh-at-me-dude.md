# Description
Crux is right of the ground before the first bolt on powerful, bouldery, slightly overhang pockets, continue up the face as it slabs out past increasingly run-out bolts to the top of the formation. Walk off the top to climber's left across slabs to milder terrain# Location
Just right of Arrowhead arete, around the corner.# Protection
Bolts: 4 Quick-draws (bring an extra) The Anchor on this climb is a single bolt on top of the formation. It is possible to sling a large flake to climbers left and create an anchor using the rope to link the flake and the bolt when belaying a second. Alternatively, use slings and cord to create a top-rope anchor using the flake and bolt.
