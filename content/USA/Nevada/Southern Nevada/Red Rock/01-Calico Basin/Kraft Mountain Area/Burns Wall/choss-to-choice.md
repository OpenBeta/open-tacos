# Description
This route still has loose holds on it.  If you go for the right holds though those are usually good.  Use a couple good underclings to climb past the first bolt then to a good position for second bolt.  Continue using edges and positive holds fight the pump to reach the anchor.# Location
First route on far left.  Just left of shut up and bolt.# Protection
6 bolts to anchor
