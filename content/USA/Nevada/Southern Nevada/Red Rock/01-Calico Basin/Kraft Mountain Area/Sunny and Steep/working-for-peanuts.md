# Description
On the far right side of theSunny and Steepwall sits a low angle, thin slab. While nowhere near as steep as its neighbors,Working for Peanutsis a good way to get things going or warm things down before/after the long hike.Begin just left of the first bolt. Climb up a very serious and tricky start to gain some easier climbing above. Hold on tight up through the second bolt and stay on those feet, work right a bit and follow the most prominent features passing three more generously spaced bolts to a chain anchor.# Location
Working for Peanutsis on the far most right side of the wall, and just right of a shallow chimney.# Protection
Five bolts and a chain anchor.
