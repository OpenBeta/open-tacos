# Description
A new route with a bit of everything: pockets, open hand jugs, and lost of edging.  Begin as for Gimme Back My Bullets and climb up the steep face clipping the first bolt to the left.  Move left on to edges and a pocket or two, then up the wall to the anchors of the 5.8.    A bit harder than Bullets, a bit easier than Tour De Pump.# Location
This new route (fall of 2010) is located between the 5.8 chimney and Gimme Back My Bullets.# Protection
6 bolts, shares anchors with the 5.8 chimney.
