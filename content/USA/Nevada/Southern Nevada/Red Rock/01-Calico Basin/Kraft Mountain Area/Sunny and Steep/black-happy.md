# Description
Nice line, but not as popular as many of the routes at this wall.   Unlike many of the routes here, this route is not juggy - it is sort of slightly overhanging with some crimps and big moves.So on the whole, it appears most folks prefer "Sunny and Steep" and some of the other routes to the right - but this is a worthwhile line and worth a spin.  Good movement with high points for continuity.# Location
This is one route right of Claim Jumpers Special, overall the second one in from the left side of the wall.# Protection
