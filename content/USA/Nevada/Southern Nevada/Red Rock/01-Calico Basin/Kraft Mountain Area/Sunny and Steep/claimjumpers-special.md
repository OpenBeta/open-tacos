# Description
Full force for the rating, this is a great route to do while at the crag. Varied in style, this line offers a lot more than steep jug pulling. Demanding precision and a good amount of thoughtClaimjumpers Specialwill keep you thinking.A dead vertical beginning leads to some difficult and hard to read terrain. A tight break, hidden edges, and few nice side-pulls keep the climbing entertaining. Pull through its low-lying committing crux to a quick rest and enjoy a more technical, more mellow dash to the chains.# Location
Claimjumpers Specialis the far-most left route at the wall. It starts steep and rounds out on a more featured face.# Protection
Five bolts to a two-bolt anchor.
