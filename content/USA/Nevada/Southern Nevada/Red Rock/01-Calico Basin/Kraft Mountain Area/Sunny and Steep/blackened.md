# Description
Another of the less popular, more crimpy, routes on the left side of the wall.A reasonable start leads to a huge move to an even more huge hold.  Then you set up for a very difficult crux with another big move.Rating is sort of a wild guess - I messed up the crux and never did really get it right:  so if you have done this before and have an opinion on the difficulty, please toss it in here.# Location
One route left of Scorpions, overall the 3rd route in from the left side of the wall.# Protection
5 bolts to anchors
