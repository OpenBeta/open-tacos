# Description
Step off a block to gain a left facing flake (the right of two). Above the flake, continue up crumbly face with horizontals to the top.Belay 2nd from slung horns on far side of summit."Walkoff" to the north. This is more of a 10 foot, no feet, vertical downclimb (pic in crag section) with high potential of ping-ponging down an ugly landing. IMO, this is the crux of the route.Highly questionable rock and the so-called "walkoff" make this a serious 5.7.# Location
Facing Caligula, scramble up the gully to the right/east of the main formation (the gully is easier, but the slot is more direct. There is a ledge at the base of a patina'd face. Hefner is on the left end of this face (Bonus Pullout Section is on the right)# Protection
gear (1/3 - 2 inches); no anchor
