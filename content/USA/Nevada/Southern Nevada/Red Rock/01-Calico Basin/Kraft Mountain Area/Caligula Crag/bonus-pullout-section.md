# Description
"Climb right facing flakes to the top" -Handren p475No anchors - belay from horns on the far side of the summit.Beware the "walkoff". This is more of a 10 foot, no feet, vertical downclimb (pic in crag section) with high potential of ping-ponging down an ugly landing.(have not climbed route - dm me with first hand info)# Location
Facing Caligula, scramble up the gully to the right/east of the main formation (the gully is easier, but the slot is more direct. There is a big ledge at the base of a patina'd face. Bonus Pullout Section is on the right end of this face before the arete (Hefner is on the left end)# Protection
no anchors
