# Description
Climb the thin and short patina covered crack down low. The crack seams out to slab about halfway up. Finish on two bolts with delicate face moves.# Location
If you're at the base of yin & yang, look down and across the gully, you'll see a big block at the bottom of the wash. This climbs the back side of said block.# Protection
Place a small cam and a nut down low. Bring two quickdraws for the the upper half and a third quickdraw if you're going to toprope (a single anchor bolt at the top has a quicklink for lowering).
