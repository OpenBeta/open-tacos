# Description
This is the good-looking, but short, finger crack on the west face of the crag. The climbing is straightforward up until where the crack pinches off; a couple of hard moves from there will get you to the top.# Location
This route is located on the west face of the crag. As you're hiking to the crag, you'll see an alcove on the west face with a finger crack on its left side and an offwidth on its right side. This route tackles the finger crack. Once on top, walk off climber's right.# Protection
Cams from purple TCU to green camalot for the finger crack; a couple of larger pieces (#3 and #4 Camalot) for the belay at the top.
