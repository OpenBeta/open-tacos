# Description
Listed in Moulin's bouldering guidebook as "right slab" V1.Begin about 20 feet right of Renewal (10c) on the east side of a large boulder beneath the Yin and Yang cliff. Tiptoe up a beautiful striped slab, angling rightward beneath an arching feature. Gain a small, right-facing corner and follow this to the top of the boulder.Protection is small and thought-provoking.Descend by either rappeling off a single bolt above Renewal, or downclimb the west/southwest side of the boulder.# Location
