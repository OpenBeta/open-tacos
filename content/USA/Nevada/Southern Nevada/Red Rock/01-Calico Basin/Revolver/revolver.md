# Description
Revolver is a non-classic overhanging invert offwidth crack that would be a boulder problem if the ground wasn't 4th class below it.  Not exactly splitter, but a fun exercise in negotiating steep wide terrain. This could be relatively easy or heinous depending on your size.# Location
Nothing near it, only vaguely Alternative Crag.Approach from Kraft parking lot, heading up the gravel road towards the abandoned foundation.  The crack can be seen above the foundation and faces east toward the parking lot. It is best to approach it from the top with a little down scramble to the base of the "route".# Protection
Bolted Toprope. A #3 BD (or equivalent) for belay directional.  Could be lead with #3 and #6 Camalot or two but would be relatively pointless. Bring a short rope and low expectations.
