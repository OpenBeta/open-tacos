# Description
The following description was taken directly from the Falcon Guide by Todd Swain."This route starts about 40' right of the last climb at an obvious right-leaning crack. Climb a varnished area (crux) to reach the crack system. Follow the main crack system up and right until it goes around a corner into a gully. Variation: Move left from the main crack system into a prominent, vertical crack and follow that to the top."This thing felt a good bit harder than 5.9 to me... but I think it was because there were a number of massive, loose blocks and the route was super chossy. This could be good if it was climbed more often and had some anchors at the top!# Location
# Protection
Standard trad rack.No anchor at the top, though if you work right to the top of the gully there is a piece of webbing on a thread through with a rap ring that will get you to the base of the gully with a single rope.
