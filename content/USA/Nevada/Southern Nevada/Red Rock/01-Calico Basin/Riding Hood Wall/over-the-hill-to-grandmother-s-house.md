# Description
Another good route on the Riding Hood Wall. Over the Hill is the crack climb that pulls through a roof with black rock, right of Physical Graffiti. Many people only do the quality first pitch, and then rappel.P1) Make sure to protect the beginning moves well. This is the crux and the landing is not great. Pull through the roof crack with varnished rock. Continue up easier climbing to some slings in the crack for a belay.P2) Continue up the same crack system for a full rope length to the top.Descent: Rap off west to a gully, then downclimb the gully. Or, walk up hill to the left across some 2nd/3rd class ramps then drop into the gulley on the left and walk down with one short, easy, non exposed, 4th class section. 5-10 min.# Location
