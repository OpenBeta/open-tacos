# Description
The impressive line between the approach pitches' anchors, capped by a very steep roof. From the 5.5 approach pitch anchor, scramble across the 4th class ramp to the center of the vertical wall. Clip bolt one, make a few moves through an opening 5.11 sequence, and follow the line for four more bolts until you're about 9 feet below the roof. Make several very hard moves on micro crimps until you can stab a hand into a little jug in the underside of the start of the roof. Gain two good holds on the lip of this initial roof, clip, and pull through three bolts of sixty degree overhanging terrain. Pull the lip, ten feet of 5.9 climbing to the anchors, and you've claimed your first ascent!Project's working name is Kodiak, for anyone that's curious. May be as hard as 5.14a... hard to tell, given it feels substantially harder than anything I've ever been on.# Location
# Protection
8 bolts to anchors. Feel free to add an additional one between bolts five and six if necessary.
