# Description
Start on the arete between the steep and slab walls of the Fringe. Climb the crack and arete around onto the pillar on the left side of the slab, then follow  the boltline just right of the arete until there's an option to split. Make exposed but safe moves around the arete onto the steep wall, joining into the base of the flake, and follow this into the last half of Lunatic. Looks great, but the few independent moves on the line add little to the climb overall.# Location
A 70m rope can lower the climber back into the bowl below Lunatic.# Protection
Bolts to chains.
