# Description
Climb the right approach pitch (5.5) to an anchor below the large corner, then step right and follow the right-hand line of bolts up an arete and then through an alley of ribbed huecos and horizontal pinches to a sit-down rest atop a small pillar. Follow the line up and around a roof to the left where a thin section past a short rightward traverse proves to be the crux. A cool climb.# Location
Rappel with one 60m rope.# Protection
Bolts to chains.
