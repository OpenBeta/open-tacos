# Description
J Nasties climbs the obvious, right leaning dihedral. Start by doing a rightward undercling traverse beneath the overhanging block. Pull around the right edge and head up the main corner. The whole thing is sort of awkward and sustained. I recall the crux being near the top of the climb, where you need to pull out of the dihedral and over a bulge onto a lower angled ramp. Belay and rappel from a cord wrapped boulder.# Location
This route is not actually on the Fringe cliff but directly to the north, beyond the east/west running gully/wash.# Protection
Standard rack.We left cord wrapped around a boulder w/ a single locker to rappel from. It's probably a good idea to bring replacement cord.
