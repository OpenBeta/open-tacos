# Description
Really a variation of Summer Session. Climb that route to the top of the pillar, but then follow the two bolts to the right through cool varnished crimpers to the anchor of Lunatic.# Location
A belayer on the approach pitch's anchor can lower the climber to the bowl below Lunatic (and perhaps to the ground) with a 60m rope.# Protection
Bolts to chains.
