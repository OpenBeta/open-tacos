Climb the left approach pitch (5.6) to a bowl with an anchor, and then follow the first three bolts of Bear My Soul. From here, break right into a left facing corner, and follow the line up and around some rotten rock where the corner steepens (crux). Easy climbing to an anchor off right, or link into Bear My Soul to finish.# Location

Bolts to chains.
