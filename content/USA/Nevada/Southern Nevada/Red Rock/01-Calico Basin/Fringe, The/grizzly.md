# Description
Climb the left approach pitch (5.6) to a bowl with an anchor, then climb the right line of bolts to a standing rest below a steep varnished wall. Climb through three bolts of positive holds that get smaller and smaller, until faced with a tiny crimp and very long reach just below the anchor (crux). A lovely climb; my favorite on the wall.# Location
Rappel with one 60m rope.# Protection
Bolts to chains.
