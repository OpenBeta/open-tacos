# Description
Kevin Clark named this route as a nod to his friend and climbing mentor, Wendell Broussard.Gear can be placed fairly frequently, with the exception of a few shallow flares and about a 15' blank stretch near the top. Thankfully you can double up on good gear before the blank section and protect well immediately after.# Location
The obvious finger sized (mostly) crack splitting the slab. 10' right of Qukenator.# Protection
Single rack to #3 Camalot. + a few extra pieces in the fingers range, depending upon comfort level. Bolted, chain anchor. 60 meter rope at a minimum, knot the end.
