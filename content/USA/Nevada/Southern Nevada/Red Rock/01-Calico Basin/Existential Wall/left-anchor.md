# Description
The app requires a grade here, I'd say 5.7-5.9ish.  This is a top rope anchor with an obvious line on the right through a leaning corner and a less obvious line on the left through a varnish patch/ seam.# Location
Climber's left anchor.  Access the top quite easily up the gully to the climber's left of the rock face.# Protection
2 bolt anchor.  Be careful of rope drag when lowering, it is a rounded top.
