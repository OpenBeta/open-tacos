# Description
This is a great toprope climb between Cowlick Co. Crag and Flying Chuckwalla. The crux is thin and keeps you on edge... just like that bad hair day you are having. There are some fun moves, trust your feet, and don't let that nasty cowlick ruin your style. The route suffers from the same bad rock as the rest of Cowlick Crag.# Location
Bad Hair Day is between the bolted routes of Cowlick Co. Crag and Flying Chuckwalla.# Protection
There are anchors and chains at the top of the route to set a toprope. They are accessible by scrambling up the wash on the left of the crag.
