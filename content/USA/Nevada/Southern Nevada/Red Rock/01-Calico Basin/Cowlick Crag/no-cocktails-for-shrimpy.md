# Description
This route climbs the right hand side of the "Shrimpy Tower" on Cowlick Crag.  Ascend the loose arete to a left leaning crack.  Climb the crack passing a small cactus to the double bolt anchor.This route shares its anchor with "The Wonderful World of Shrimpy."The Shrimpy name is derived from the name that Krista and I have given our as yet unborn child.  On the ultrasound, the baby looks like a shrimp.  And thus, we have dubbed it Shrimpy!# Location
