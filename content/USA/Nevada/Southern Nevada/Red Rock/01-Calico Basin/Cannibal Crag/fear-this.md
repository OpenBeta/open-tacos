# Description
This nondescript route is found on the west side of the Cannibal crag.  Climb two bolts of easy terrain to a few bouldery moves through a bulge which comes at the third and final bolt.  From here it is a bit of a run to the anchor on easier ground.  I think that I noticed a place you could put a fingerish sized cam in a horizontal if you wanted to cut down the distance between the last bolt and the chains.# Location
West side of Cannibal crag, between Have a Beer with Fear and Elbows of Mac and Ronnie.# Protection
3 bolts (maybe one fingerish sized cam?) to Mussy hooks.
