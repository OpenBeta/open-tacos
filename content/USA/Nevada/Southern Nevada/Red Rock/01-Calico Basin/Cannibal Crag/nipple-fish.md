# Description
Begin at a scoop to the right of Fear This Sport.  Start by climbing the right of the scoop and trend left for a few bouldery moves.  Easier climbing after the first bolt.  An easier version of Fear This Sport; will clean up nicely with some travel.# Location
Right of Fear This Sport.  This route was bolted some years ago and appears in the old Swain book as a project.  The bolts were pulled and as far as I know, the line was never sent.  I re-bolted this route in early Sept., 2007.  If it was sent before, then I hope an old route has been resurrected.  Enjoy!# Protection
Four bolts and shared anchors with Fear this Sport.  Optional - Clipping the last bolt of Fear This Sport.  Stick clip first bolt!!!  Soon I will add an extra bolt for the start.
