# Description
Begins at the left edge of a white boulder that leans against the wall.  A little thin above the second bolt, but fairly straitforward.Roxanna's book says that you must set up a gear anchor at the top of this climb.  There have since been bolts with chains installed at the top.This climb is a good warm up for the 5.10a's to either side of it.# Location
# Protection
3 bolts to an anchor with lower-off hooks
