# Description
The left handed crimp off of the left-facing jug flake near the bottom is definitely harder than 5.9 as is suggested by the Swain guidebook. The rest of the route is mellow.# Location
About 10 feet left ofA Man in Every Pot, and in front of the rightmost of two similarly-sized scrub oak bushes.# Protection
3 bolts (I think a 4th was added after the Brock book's printing) up to the chain anchors.
