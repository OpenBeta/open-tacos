# Description
This route follows the stunning arete feature on the NE side of the Cannibal Boulder.  Easy climbing up to the second bolt, where the real fun begins.  From here it gets steep and interesting.  The crux begins after the third bolt is clipped and includes a few desparate moves to surmount the cock, and a very desparate and kind of scary clip for the 4th bolt.  From there, a few airy crimpers lead up to bolted anchors.This is a wonderful spot to get good climbing shots from the ground if you are a photographer.  The arete stands out against the skyline from both sides and the overhanging line looks absolutely awesome.  Be sure to bring your core face for the onlookers who frequent the area!# Location
