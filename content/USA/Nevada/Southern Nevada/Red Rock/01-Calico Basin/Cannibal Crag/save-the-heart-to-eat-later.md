# Description
A crimpy face climb that climbs the middle of the boulder. The crux is related to the holds disappearing the higher you go (past the 4th bolt).# Location
It is common to use the same start asPickled Cock, atop the large raised platform to avoid the petroglyphs. Climb up and right to the first bolt and then begin angling up and left for the rest of the route.# Protection
6 bolts to the chain anchors.
