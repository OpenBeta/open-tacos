# Description
No longer a great route for beginners, as the anchor is gone. If you climb this, after the third bolt you'll have to run it out to the top of the formation, belay your second up from a single bolt, and then walk off.Note: This route is really more like 5.6, but both guides call it 5.7-.# Location
This is the route furthest to the right as you face the WNW side of the boulder. It begins on the varnished face at the obvious left-facing crescent.# Protection
3 bolts, and a runout to the top. Belay from the top of the boulder at a single bolt, or further back to the double bolt anchor (lots more rope drag).
