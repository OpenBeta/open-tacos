# Description
A decent route with crack and face climbing, and good rest positions.# Location
Begin on the right side of the major crack system running through the middle of the boulder, 5 feet to the right ofYou Are What You Eat. Follow this crack up for about 20 feet, and then face climb past the bolts up to the anchor.# Protection
The PG rating can be eliminated by placing some medium sized gear in the crack down low. Clip 3-4 bolts on your way up to the chain anchors.
