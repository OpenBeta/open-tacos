# Description
After the first bolt there a reachy section that is a little sketchy if this is at your limit. The crux for a lot of people comes toward the top as your forearms begin to feel it. There is a nice jug a little above the forth bolt to clip from instead of making the hard clip from the crimps below.# Location
This route climbs the right side of the main arete formed by the North and East faces, immediately to the right and around the corner fromCaustic Cock.# Protection
4 bolts and then traverse to the cold shut anchor up and to the right (a little runout and some rope drag, but solid).
