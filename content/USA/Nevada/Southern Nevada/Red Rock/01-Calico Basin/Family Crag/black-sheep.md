# Description
Left of the sport routes, a chimey/gully leads upward. Follow this up low fifth class moves, moving into fun, easy chimneying, eventually breaking slightly right onto the face to the best holds, moving straight up, or travesing right to join cold shuts on the leftmost sport route.# Location
Far left of cliff, just past a bolted route.# Protection
A couple of large cams were all I used. More gear could be found, but fans of constant pro will be dismayed by the face.
