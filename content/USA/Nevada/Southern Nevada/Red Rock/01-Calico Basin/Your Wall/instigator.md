# Description
Start at the right side of the main wall, to the left of the corner/ramp, at a low first bolt. Climb up thin, crimpy moves to reach the huecos. The start is hard, but itâ€™s possible to mollycoddle yourself and traverse into the climb around the second/third bolt. Mollycoddling makes the climb 5.10.# Location
Right side of the wall, to the left of the corner/ramp.# Protection
6 bolts, ring anchors at the top
