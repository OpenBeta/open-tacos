# Description
good holds, but relatively sparse protection after you leave the ramp and head up the face, above.# Location
Start at the bottom of a right-trending ramp, which is to the left of All That Jazz / Spontaneous Enjoyment. When the ramp ends go straight up the face to the anchor.# Protection
take some slings for chickenheads and a small rack.
