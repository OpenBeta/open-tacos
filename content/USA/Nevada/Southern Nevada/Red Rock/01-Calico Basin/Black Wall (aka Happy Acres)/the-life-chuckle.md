# Description
This route has a lot of fun climbing with some soft and/or loose rock. Start by climbing the corner with a sweet, laser cut, lie-back crack. Follow the line, passing several obstacles. There is a ledge at about 120 feet up where you can build a belay. You can walk off to the right from here or do a short second pitch to the top. From the top, you also walk off right, same as All That Jazz.# Location
The Life Chuckle is in the left-facing corner to the left of the sport routes of Black Wall (Happy Acres). You can access the tiers below the route by approaching from the right, from the base of sport routes (ie Mom and Apple Pie).# Protection
Standard rack. We used a double rack of cams up to 3" and a single 4" plus a full set of nuts.
