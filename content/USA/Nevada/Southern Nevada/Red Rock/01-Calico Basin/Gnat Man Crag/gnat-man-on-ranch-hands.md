# Description
For those trying to pull extra hard at the Gnat Man Crag. Just to the left of Knock the Bottom out of it, start up a cool hueco/cave system to a high first bolt. Crank the crimpy and kind of scary crux to a difficult second clip. Another couple bolts lead to the obligatory Gnat Man slab runout to a gear anchor way up high. Not much change for gear up high.# Location
The obvious hueco system to the right of the large corner/crack system in the middle of the cliff. Identified by a lack of chalk and a very high (20') first bolt.# Protection
5 bolts.
