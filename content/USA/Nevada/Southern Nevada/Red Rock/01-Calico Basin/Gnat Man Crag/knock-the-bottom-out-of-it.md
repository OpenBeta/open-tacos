# Description
Start just left of Bottoms Up below a patch of varnish. Climb slabby wall past 4 bolts. Easy up high. Crux is getting to the first bolt. The move is committing and awkward. I got a "good" RP in a seam by the large hole/pocket. Good climbing past the bolts.# Location
Start just left of Bottoms Up. Descent is the same as the other routes on this wall# Protection
Bolts. Optional sz(0/1)RP to protect move getting to the first bolt.
