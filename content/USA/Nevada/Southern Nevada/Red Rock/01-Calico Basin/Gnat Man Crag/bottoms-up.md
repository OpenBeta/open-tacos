# Description
Good crack, good pro, spicy crux (for 5.7 anyway).Bottoms Up is the well-defined left-facing corner, and disjoint cracks, located on the right side of Gnat Man Crag. Negotiate a tricky start in the clean corner, then head up the classic crack, place some good pro below the bulge and head left and up to the next crack. Follow the 2nd crack as it angles right to the two-bolt anchor.The bulge is definitely the mental crux, because there isn't any pro until you reach the 2nd crack.The height of the bolt anchors is about 27 meters, so a 60m rope is sufficient.Descent: Rappel from the bolted anchor. If this anchor goes missing, head right/west until you find easy 3rd class terrain to scramble back to the valley floor.# Location
# Protection
Standard rack up to a #3 Camalot.There's a two bolt anchor at the top.
