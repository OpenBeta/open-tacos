# Description
The right hand route on the wall below Chicken Gumbo, with "5.11c" scratched into a rock at the base. Climb the steep wall to a sit down rest, the pull cool moves out the roof to an awkward bulge and anchors. Some of the rock is incredibly suspect... be mindful of what you're pulling on. My friend and I are in agreement that this route's name should be "Chosstastic": fantastic if not for the choss.# Location
