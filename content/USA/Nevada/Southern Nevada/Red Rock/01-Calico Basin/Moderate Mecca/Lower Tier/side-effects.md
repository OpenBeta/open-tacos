# Description
This sporty route climbs a short crack and then huecos up a large detached boulder that guards the entrance to Moderate Mecca.The lower crack could be protected by natural gear but contains several bolts.  I would recommend unclipping the first bolt after passing it to reduce drag.  This climb is almost a one move wonder but the rest of the climbing is so good you don't care.  Overall this climb presents a fun jaunt.# Location
