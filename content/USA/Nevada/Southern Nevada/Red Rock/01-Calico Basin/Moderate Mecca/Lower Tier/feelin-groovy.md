# Description
The left hand route on the wall below Chicken Gumbo, with "5.11a Rotten" scratched into a rock at the base. Climb the steep wall to a great rest, then fire the roof around to the anchor. Rock quality is VERY suspect in places... test what you're pulling on.# Location

7 bolts to chains.
