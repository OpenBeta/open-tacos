# Description
Although Valentine's Day gets all the traffic, this is definitely a not to be missed line if you're in the area. The Haj starts out in a left leaning dihedral and works up to an interesting exit move from the dihedral. From there, easy terrain leads up and right to a communal rap anchor.Start left of Scalawag and Carpetbagger on the ledge system. Look for an acacia bush and then look up for the steep, varnished corner that is this fine route.# Location
# Protection
A standard rack will do- a two bolt anchor up and right gets you back to the deck with a single 60m.
