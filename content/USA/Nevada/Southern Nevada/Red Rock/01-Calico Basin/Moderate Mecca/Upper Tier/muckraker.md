# Description
This climb is so-so, not only is it not a destination climb for Red Rocks, it isn't really even a must-do at Moderate Mecca. It is slightly dirty and somewhat uninteresting.To find Muckraker first locate Scalawag. Starting from the left end of Moderate Mecca's Left side, walk back to the right to find an obvious roof crack with hands-to-off-hands jams and a few holds above the lip; this is Scalawag.Perhaps 2-3 meters still further right is a second crack system that climbs out and round the roof's right side, then up a fist crack towards the top. At the top of this climb, you can step left to rap from the Scalawag anchors or right from the anchors shared with Fleet Street. I don't recall an independent anchor there.# Location
