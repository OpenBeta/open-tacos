# Description
Carpetbagger is located on the far west side of the Moderate Mecca formation.  Traverse the shelf past the obvious dihedrals Chicken Gumbo and Valentine's Day.  Keep traverseing the shelf past a huge overhang with a boulder at the base (Scalawag), and you'll see a large open book.Climb the open book past several miniature overhangs.  The climbing is very easy between each little bulge.  Look for fixed anchors off to the left, which are hidden until you get near them.Rap the route, as the anchors are not at the top of the cliff.# Location
