# Description
This climb is just to the left of the major deep dihedral closest to the parking area.  Climb up a shallow corner only a 5 feet left of Chicken Gumbo (the major dihedral).  This route barely feels like a unique route due to its close proximity to its neighbor.Set up a gear anchor, then the base can be reached by a walk off to the right.# Location
