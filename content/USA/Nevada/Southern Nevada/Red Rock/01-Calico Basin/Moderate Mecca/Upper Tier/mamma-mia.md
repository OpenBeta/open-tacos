# Description
This route is the face climb between From Soup to Nuts and Soupy Sales.  For the full grade, do not use either of those cracks or edges.  Face climb only.  Must construct a top rope anchor at the top of the crag, no chains or bolts exist.  The crux is the first 15 feet of bouldery moves. Rest of the climb is 5.7ish. Fun climb.# Location
