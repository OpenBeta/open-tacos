# Description
This route is a fun top rope and a bold lead. Technical and powerful moves get you off the ground and into the fun face section before the crux traverse. Fun steep climbing gets you to the anchor. As always in Red Rock pull down not out. Don't blow it on lead...!!# Location
The route starts @15 left of Pending Disaster at a flare with small pro. Move up and right using seam for pro. Move left at dark sloppy traverse. Then straight up to the anchors. Rappel from Pending Disasters' anchor.# Protection
Brass, med stoppers, small cams(00-.5 bd), and an optional #3-#4 bd. A few extendable runners. Rap/TR off of the Pending Disaster. Use a long extension to TR.
