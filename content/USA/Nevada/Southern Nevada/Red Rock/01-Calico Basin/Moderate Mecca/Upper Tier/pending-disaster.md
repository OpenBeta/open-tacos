# Description
The Swain Book calls this 'one of the better routes at the crag.' As it were, it might be one of the few deserving of 2 stars. This climb is nice, and is fun, but is not a standout at Red Rocks.Starting from the left end of Moderate Mecca's Left side, find the obvious roof crack of Scalawag, then facing the cliff, look to the right to the large arÃªte split by cracks. Large splotches of white calcite pepper the area. Climb a left-leaning crack up to a crack system that has a tricky move or two, then upward and onward to a fixed anchor above.Rap back to the junky, but adequate ledge system from the anchor up top.# Location
