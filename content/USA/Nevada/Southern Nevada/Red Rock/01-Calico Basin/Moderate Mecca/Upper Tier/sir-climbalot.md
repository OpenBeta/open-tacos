# Description
Sir Climbalot sits at the far left side of Moderate Mecca between The Road to Mecca on the left and The Haj on the right, above an acacia tree. Start at the same spot as for The Haj, and bear up and left along the angling crack and corner system. At about sixty feet up, on easier ground, bear right to the communal anchor, a pair of bolts with chains on a vertical face. Watch for scree toward the top. Rappel with a 60m rope.# Location
