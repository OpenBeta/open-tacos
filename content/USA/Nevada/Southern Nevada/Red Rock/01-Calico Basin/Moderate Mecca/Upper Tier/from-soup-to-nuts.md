# Description
This climb is the crack 30 feet to the left of the major deep dihedral closest to the parking area (Chicken Gumbo).  Climb up the length of the crack, the crux being the first 10 feet.  The crux area is also fairly difficult to protect, so be careful.Set up a gear anchor, then the base can be reached by a walk off to the right.# Location
