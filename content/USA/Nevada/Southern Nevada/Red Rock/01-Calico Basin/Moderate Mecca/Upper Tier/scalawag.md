# Description
The gymnastics of this climb are nice, and it is well-protected and fun, but is not a standout at red rocks. It's slightly dirty and sharp nature, as well as it's one-move-wonderness prevent this from being a destination climb.To find Scalawag, starting from the left end of Moderate Mecca's Left side, then walk back to the right to find an obvious roof crack with hands-to-off-hands jams and a few holds above the lip. Climb up under a large roof and work out on the left side wall, stemming and protecting overhead all the while, before launching into the roof moves, which go horizontal. Pull the lip and pro again, then wander up the lower angle face on a shallow crack system.The anchors at the top are for rapping, but if you protected before the roof, lowing off might trash your rope. As well, if your second hang-dogs before cleaning under the roof, it will hack your rope.# Location
