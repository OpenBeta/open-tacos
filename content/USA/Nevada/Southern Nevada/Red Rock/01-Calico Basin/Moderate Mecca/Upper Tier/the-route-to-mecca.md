# Description
A fun route to hop on, if you are already planning on heading out to the area. The more popular climb "The Haj"(5.9),shares an anchor with this route. "The route to Mecca" starts 10 feet or so left of "Sir Climbalot"(5.7PG)and"The Haj"(5.9).  Climb the short,left facing corner,then pull up over the well protected bulge(crux)continuing to climb the fun,  left facing corner/crack that will exit onto a couple of ledges. Scramble up the ledges(watch out for the barrel cactus)to a bolted communal anchor on a nice sized ledge. Rappel with one 60 meter rope.# Location
