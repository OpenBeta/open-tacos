# Description
Right at the VERY beginning is a deceiving move off the deck that looks easy and then is hard to get your feet up high to the holds.  After the original boulder move the route is actually VERY good following some small flakes and face holds.  Good route!# Location
At a funky grey colored bolt and hanger around the arete from Stew on This.  Pull the bulge, then follow the thin seam just left of the arete.# Protection
A couple of bolts and some helpful small gear placements.  Shares anchors with Stew on This for your rappel.
