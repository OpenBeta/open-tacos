# Description
This route is only a toprope route.  It is a steep jug haul up sometimes sharp holds.  This is one of the first climbs encountered when approaching from the parking lot.  It is on a steep face just right of a deep dihedral (Chicken Gumbo for Your Dumbo 5.6).  Start up the dihderal, then traverse right soon after using the obvious hueco holds.  Finish with a direct line up the face.# Location
# Protection
Some cams for a toprope anchor.  There may also be one bolt?
