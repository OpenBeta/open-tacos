# Description
This climb is the major deep dihedral closest to the parking area.  Climb up the obvious dihedral to the top.  The climbing is quite good, but awkward because the right face of the dihedral always seems to be in the way!Set up a gear anchor, then the base can be reached by a walk off to the right.# Location
