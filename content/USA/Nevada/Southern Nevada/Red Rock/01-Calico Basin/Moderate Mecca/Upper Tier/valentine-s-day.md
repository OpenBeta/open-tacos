# Description
This is one of the most obvious routes at the crag and perhaps the first one done.  It is a huge left facing corner around the corner from the first few routes you come to.I'd recommend taping up.  The crack is somewhat awkward but has some great jams and stem rests.  Two bolt anchor at the top on the left.# Location
