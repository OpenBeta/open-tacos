# Description
Fantastic thin route just left of Valentine's Day corner!  Takes VERY thin gear and leading would only be for the seasoned trad climber IMHO.  Great movement and easily toproped from the Valentine's Day anchors.# Location
Start of route is about 10 feet left of Valentine's Day; follow thin cracks straight up face and rappel from anchors on ledge above.# Protection
This gear; mostly small wires and brass nuts.  No bolts on route but fixed anchors are shared with Valentine's Day!
