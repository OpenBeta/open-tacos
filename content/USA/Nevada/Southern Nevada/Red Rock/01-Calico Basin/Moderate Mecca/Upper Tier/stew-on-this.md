# Description
The start of this route is marked by a bolt with a homemade hanger just above a varnished overhang. This climb is just to the right of The route's "Is it Soup yet?" and "Chicken soup for the soul".Mantle to a stance above the overhang, then move right towards the second bolt. Apparently there is a spot for a cam in between the bolts, but it is not critical as the climbing between the 2 bolts is very moderate.# Location
