# Description
A funky line that is not for everyone. A wide layback with one bolt leads to an "a cheval" ride across the top of the flake, clipping 2 bolts, then steep pulling over a bulge to a gear-protected seam. This leads up crispy crack to a rest stance, some sketchball loose flake wrestling, a fixed thread, and a short corner leading to a roof with a downward-facing half inch bolt. Pull right around the roof, clip a high bolt, navigate through steep terrain to one last bolt, and make a final throw to a jug and clip chains at chest level. If you clip the chains before the throw, you wussed out.# Location
Just right of Rocky Road, a good landmark is the wide layback crack up the smooth slab.# Protection
Eight bolts and a single rack to 1", maybe a second set of TCUs for those wanting to load up the gear. We found ballnutz useful but others may demur. Long slings or double rope technique will be appreciated when hitting the steeps on this long pitch. 70M rope required to lower.
