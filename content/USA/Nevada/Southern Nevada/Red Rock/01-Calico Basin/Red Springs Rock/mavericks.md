# Description
An airy and varied line. Follows a zigzagging line of holds toward a seam that arcs through a steep headwall. Black slab with plentiful holds to a bulge initial crux around 10-, then up a slab to a vertical pocket and flake section, a good rest before the steepness,and then sequential movement up a reachy throw crux and pumping to the chains. A much easier red point than onsight.# Location
The big face to the right of Rocky Road, this is the line on the right that starts up a black slab via face climbing.# Protection
13 bolts to ring anchors. Worthwhile on this line to bring some 24" slings for the bolts in the middle section to keep rope drag down, it's a long pitch and it follows an 'S' profile. 60 M rope required to lower.
