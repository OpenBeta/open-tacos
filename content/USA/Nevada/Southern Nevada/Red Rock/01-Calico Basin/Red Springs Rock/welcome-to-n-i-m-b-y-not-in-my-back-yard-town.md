# Description
Really good and fun route to combine in a day with Classic Corner with fun movements over somewhat run-out climbing between the bolts.  The moves feel pretty so don't stress about the bolts too much!# Location
This route is the south facing feature about 50 feet right of Classic Corner of Calico and just right of a chossy corner!  Look for the four bolts up the face!# Protection
4 Bolts to the fixed anchors at the top!
