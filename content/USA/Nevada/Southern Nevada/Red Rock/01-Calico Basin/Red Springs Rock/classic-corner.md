# Description
Wow, this climb is pure joy. It is aesthetic, has fun jams, and good pro. Climb the prominent dihedral that first angles left, then angles right around a corner and out of sight. As you get near the top of the dihedral, you can step left into a bigger and easier crack/gully; or continue in the dihedral and escape with an easy off-width move. Belay at the top of the crack/gully using some smaller cams, or move higher and belay at the top of a flat ledge using a double sling around a big rock and some small cams. The total climb is about 100 feet.There are a pair of bolts to use for the anchor.  They are off to the climber's left and slightly obscured by some bushes.  A 70m rope will get you down with some to spare.Alternatively, you can down climb a short 4th class section and walk down the big ravine (South-West of the belay).GETTING THERE: From the 1st picnic area at Red Rock Spring head West up the hill and to the right of Jabba The Hut Rock (the first band of rocks). Then, turn left (South) and scramble up a blonde 4th class ramp. This will place you roughly at the base of the Classic Corner.# Location
