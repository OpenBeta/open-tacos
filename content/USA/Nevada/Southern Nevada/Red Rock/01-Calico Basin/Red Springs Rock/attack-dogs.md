# Description
Fun climb featuring really cool moves through a lieback past the second bolt!  The 10c comes at the beginning moving out of the smooth corner onto the lower angled face above and then is about 5.9.# Location
Located about 10 feet right of NIMBY route, just look for the smooth small corner.  Route is pretty well protected and recommended!# Protection
5 Bolts will get you to the fixed anchors above and are shared with Welcome to NIMBY Town.
