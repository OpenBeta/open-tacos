# Description
Boulder Dash climbs the right bolted line through the center of the face.  Pull a low roof and follow an easy section to a crack feature in the base of the headwall.  The crux comes in the first 10ft off the lower angle rock, so clipping the bolt after the crux maybe a little heady, but there is a good hold to do it from.The climbing on the upper headwall is on small varnish crimps which is quite continuous.# Location
Located on a nice varnished wall to the left of Allied Forces.# Protection
7 bolts...
