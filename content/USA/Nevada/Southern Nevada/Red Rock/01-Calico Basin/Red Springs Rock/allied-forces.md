# Description
The flare/OW formed by the left side of a huge flake.  Approximately 30m to the left of Classic Corner.  Good strenuous fun.# Location
Walk off to the right, down the Classic Corner gully.# Protection
Gear to #6 Camalot helpful.  The squeeze job Contempt of Court is just to the left, providing several bolts when the going gets scary.
