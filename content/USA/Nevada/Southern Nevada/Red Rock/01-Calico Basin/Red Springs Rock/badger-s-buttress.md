# Description
This climb is located about 50 feet South (to the left) of the Classic Corner and follows the prominent low angled arête.  Start on the left side of the arête and climb up and over a couple of easy ledges.  Place some pro.  Then, move right and onto the arête with instant exposure.  Continue up the arête passing two bolts and several opportunities for small cams.  The climbing is more challenging then it appears from the base and is slightly run out in sections.  Belay at the top of a flat ledge using a double sling around a big rock and some small cams.  The total climb is about 100 feet.To exit, down climb a short 4th class section and walk down the big ravine (South-West of the belay).# Location
