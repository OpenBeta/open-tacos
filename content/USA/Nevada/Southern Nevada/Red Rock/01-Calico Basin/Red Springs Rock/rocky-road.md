# Description
Rocky Road is a tough little OW. If you're a fledgling OW leader this would be a good candidate to break into the grade. The crux is, obviously, well protected and short lived. However, the remainder of the climb will prove to be a challenge if this is your first foray into the wonderful world of offwidth.There are two ways to start the climb: one way would be to start directly below Allied Forces and follow a finger to hand crack and pull the bulge using face holds and fire into the meat of Rocky Road. The other option would be to start about 15 to the right of Allied Forces and climb up easy (5.7) terrain into a 3" crack up to the bulging corner/crack. The obvious bulge is what you're looking at getting into. From there fire straight up the left-facing offwidth corner for 100 feet of grueling fun.# Location
