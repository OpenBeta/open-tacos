# Description
Despite some poor looking rock, the climbing is steep and fun and the big holds all live on dude! Begin on big opposing side pulls. A big move up begins the sequence up and right past big holds and the first bolt. Continue up and right to a second bolt and use a long sling here. From here it's straight up the hardest moves to the top of the formation and a two-bolt anchor.# Location
Right route on the formation. Currently the only route present.# Protection
3 bolts to a 2-bolt anchor with quicklinks.
