# Description
This stout roof is probably as neglected as Shit Howdy, but it is well worth the hike, especially if you start your day on Shit Howdy. Burl up the obvious crack system to the roof, continue the burl fest through the roof to the chains.# Location
This route is not located on the Shit Howdy boulder, but rather up and right, just about halfway between Physical Graffitti and Shit Howdy. If you're at Shit Howdy, look for the large hueco (3+ feet) on a cliff a little up and right. Risk Brothers is directly above this on the next major cliff) From Shit Howdy- head up to the crest of the hills and then right along the top, dropping down when the first real choice presents itself. You should see an obvious 3' wide ledge about 6' up running along the base of a cliff. Risk Brothers heads up the middle of this cliff. The best bet is to spot the cliff from the parking lot and keep it in view.# Protection
