# Description
This is quite a nice climb that rarely gets done. Most people never make it past the sport routes on the Cannibal Crag. The route consits of a right curving crack the follows the hillside up. The first crux comes about 15' up and involves a long reach to a nice finger lock. The second crux is a bit higher and consists of a flared fingerlock to a good hand jam. Make sure to place a piece in the alcove to protect your follower on the crux moves. Coming out of the alcove and traversing the crack to the finish is still a bit tricky.# Location
The obvious diagonaling crack up the center of the north face.# Protection
One .75 camalot and doubles of .50 camalots and smaller should get you up. You will need a 00 metolius for the first crux and a 0 metolius for the alcove. A #2 camalot will protect the final hand traverse.
