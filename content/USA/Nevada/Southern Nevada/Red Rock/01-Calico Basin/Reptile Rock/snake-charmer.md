# Description
The Snake Charmer is a fun little route that may be found on the right side of Reptile Rock.  The line ascends an obvious dogleg crack in 2-4 pitches (depending on how you do it.)Pitch One:Ascend third class terrain to the base of the dogleg crack (3rd 45').  Certainly this may be scrambled and not pitched out.Pitch Two:Climb the right trending dogleg crack.  The crux is right off the anchor -- it's a good idea to put in an anchor, because if someone blows off, you'll both take a ride down the third class terrain.  Follow the crack to a double bolt anchor at a ledge at the base of a vertical crack (70' 5.6)Pitch Three:Climb straight up the crack, passing an annoying tree, to the face above.  Beware the loose holds on the upper face. Pass three bolts to an anchor.  It is possible to rappel the route from here.Pitch Four:Optional pitch -- some may find it easier to do another short pitch to the top of the feature.From the top of the crag, step across a small gully and climb a low angle crack to an easy descent.# Location
