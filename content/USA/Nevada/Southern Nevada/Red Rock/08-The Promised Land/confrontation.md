# Description
This is the third route from the left and a crag classic. Start up a white slab on small exfoliating holds to a decent pod. From the pod climb up and right and then move back left to arrive at the right side of the black and blue streaks. Continue up the streak on amazingly solid and sustained holds.# Location
Third route from the left on the wall. Around 40' right of the center of the cave.# Protection
10 bolts to fixed anchors.
