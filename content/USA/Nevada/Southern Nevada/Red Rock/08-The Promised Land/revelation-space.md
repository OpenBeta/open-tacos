# Description
Start in the same spot as Fist full and Day 1. Clip the bolt to the left. Climb through tufa pinches to the first crux, rest, then dive into the roof and navigate well spaced tufas and jugs. The Anchors are in the second brown roof. This route transects Smite by The Sword and could be done as a link up into The Sacred and Profane.This was an abandoned project from the early 2000's.# Location
