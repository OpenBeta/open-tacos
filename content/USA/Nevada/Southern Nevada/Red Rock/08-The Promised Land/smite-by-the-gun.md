# Description
A demanding opening boulder problem with downright horrible feet but juggy underclings, trends right and then you're rewarded with amazing blue colonnettes and pumpy, steep jugs to the summit. A really nice pitch if you don't mind the start.# Location
Shares the first bolt with Under the Gun - although stick clipping the second bolt is recommended.# Protection
