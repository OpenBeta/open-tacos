# Description
Crown of Thorns adds a natural finish and another 30ft of steep power endurance climbing to the top of Day One. Climb Day One to the jug at the base of the large roof. Get as much back as possible, then climb slightly left through a difficult undercling boulder problem to access a horn. From the horn, move back right through another difficult undercling section to finish with a delicate slab move before the chains.Crown of Thorns was originally bolted and abandoned in 2001 and just recently saw a first ascent.# Location
Start as for Day One and keep going straight up.# Protection
10 bolts and fixed anchors.
