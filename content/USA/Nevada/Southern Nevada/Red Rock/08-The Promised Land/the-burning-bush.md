# Description
Some historians have suggested Moses was smoking Acacia leaves which contain DMT. And thus saw God, not in the burning bush, but "through it." Climb the easy slab on tufas directly in front of the small pine tree. Then bust into the steepness with an in your face boulder problem. The route remains thuggy but the holds get better. Clip the anchor in the middle of the wall off a proper jug flake.This was an abandoned project from the late 90s.# Location
In between Spectrum and The Sacred and Profane directly in front of the small Pine tree.# Protection
6 bolts to anchors.
