# Description
Wander up a drippy slab and through some incredibly featured rock on this wicked climb. The difficulty slowly increases as you head towards the chains, ending with a crux just below the finish. Underclings, sidepulls, and very few flat holds make this an interesting and engaging pitch. Solid for the grade and a great power endurance test-piece.Older topos list this route ending up and right at an anchor in the roof - recently the trend has been to clip the chain draw from the jug, before the start of 'Crown of Thorns' and call it good.# Location
The first route on the right side of the cave.# Protection
