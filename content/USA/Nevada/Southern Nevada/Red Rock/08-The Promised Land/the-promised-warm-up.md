# Description
A nice warm up for the crag, and depending on what season you're up there - it will be a WARM up no doubt (read: gets a lot of sun). Follow a series of flakes and edges up some blue streaked stone. Very enjoyable.# Location
On the short buttress facing dead south, situated almost inside of the cave. Right of Truth or Dare.# Protection
