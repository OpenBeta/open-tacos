# Description
This route shares the same start as Who Deany before crossing left and shooting up the arete on the far left side of the main face of the Illusion Crags.Climb the Who Deany crack for around 10 feet until you can traverse left for 15 feet in a horizontal crack to the arete. Climb straight up past a overhanging vertical crack - the exposure here is surprising for a 5.8 route. Head up easier terrain to the top.This route shares the two bolt anchor that is on top of Who Deany. Rappel with a single rope.Direct start variation: climb the arete straight up from the ground (5.10).# Location
