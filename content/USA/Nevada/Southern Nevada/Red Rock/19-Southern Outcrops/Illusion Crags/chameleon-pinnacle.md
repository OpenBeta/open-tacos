# Description
A fun romp up good, solid rock with nice plate features.Start out on lighter colored rock, move up to the sweet varnished goodness.Route can be started at the same location as Morph Out, or, the nicer flat area of the Changeling to the right.Fun!# Location
Up the middle upper face between Morph Out and the Changeling. Â Start on either aforementioned route and traverse into the upper middle face.# Protection
Set of nuts and set of especially smaller cams from 0 TCU to #1 Camalot.  Good horizontals for cams and surprisingly good, captive stopper placements.  Use the rappel anchor consisting of a mess of slings threaded behind a block.Rumor has possibility of topping out the pinnacle with descend down gully to the west?  Maybe so...
