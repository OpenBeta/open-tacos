# Description
3 lines right of Sensible. 1 wide looking crack, 1 topropable face on granite-hard rock, and a thin crack also on bullet varnish. Lead the cracks (the thin one is necky) or top rope all 3 from the same anchor you build.  A nice way to add a quick 100 feet of climbing without leaving the alcove.# Location
The 2 cracks right of Sensible, and gearless face between them.# Protection
Trad anchor on top. Rap off tree at the top..
