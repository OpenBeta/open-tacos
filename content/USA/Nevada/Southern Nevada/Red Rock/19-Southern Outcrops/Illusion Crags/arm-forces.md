# Description
This route is located on the far left side of the Illusion Crags, about 15 feet right of French Bulges in a prominent right facing corner that features three roofs. The route starts on a small belay ledge at a yucca, just below some bushes. Ascend the corner, working some cracks on the left side and then pull the roofs. Very fun.There is a two bolt anchor on the ledge above the third roof. You can rappel off the route, preferably with a single 70 meter rope - just watch your ends! Also watch out when you pull your rope, there is a high potential for snagging it in a crack.There is also a very easy walk off, immediately to the climber's left (south) of the bolted anchor on the top-out ledge. Follow cairns down and traversing southward into the gulley. This gulley returns you to the base of the route.# Location
