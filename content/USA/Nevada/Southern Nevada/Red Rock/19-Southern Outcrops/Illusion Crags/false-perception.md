# Description
Very thin face climbing for 4 bolts, with a groundfall potential getting to the 2nd bolt.  Pull a bulge about halfway up on good holds (some are fragile), to another thin section.  The top section takes small gear but the climbing isn't as hard as the bottom.# Location
Just right of Skinny Mini, shares anchors.  A 70m rope barely reaches up and down with stretch.# Protection
Mostly bolted (careful getting to the 2nd bolt), the last 20 feet take small TCU's or C3s.
