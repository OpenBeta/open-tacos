# Description
This route has sections of excellent climbing on excellent rock.  Other parts of it are not as good.  The climb's name relates to the fact that this was Sendi's first new route in Red Rock.  She is a wilderness planner with the Bureau of Land Management...Start just left of the toe of the buttress and go up the left side of a brushy alcove to the left of Prime Rib.  Pass a large chockstone on its left and belay on a large ledge.  Climb above the left side of the ledge to a big right-facing corner with a bulge at its base.  Climb the corner and continue up the crack system for a few hundred feet until the gully becomes blocked by a short, narrow chimney.  Climb the chimney.  At the top of the chimney, the FA party continued up the face to its left on unprotected face climbing; there might be better options to the right.# Location
