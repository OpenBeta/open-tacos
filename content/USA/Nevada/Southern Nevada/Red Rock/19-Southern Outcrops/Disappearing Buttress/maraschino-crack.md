# Description
This nice crack climb is an interesting route at the top of the shoulder where most of the main routes finish.  As such, it is a good, end-of-day bonus climb.  The cherry on top, if you will...  Routefinding is easy-- start below and right of the main crack, then climb to the top.  To descend, scramble west and down from the big pine tree to rappel slings on a smaller tree overlooking the gully.  Do a single rope rappel and scramble back to the base.# Location
Most easily reached by getting to the top of the Disappearing Buttress by climbing one of its routes.  Then walk along the right (north) side of the ridge for 100 yards to the obvious face.# Protection
The lower part of the route uses mostly small gear.  For the upper crack you can use a number 3 & 4 Camalot.  Two of each might make you feel better about walking them...
