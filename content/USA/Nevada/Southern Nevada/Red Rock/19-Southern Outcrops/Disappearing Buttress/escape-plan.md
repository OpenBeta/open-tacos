# Description
Starting as #4's and widening to squeeze, mitigate a slight bulge and make your way to the top.  Too short, but still sweet.This problem requires a bit of actual OW technique, but the crux is tamed by a solid rail behind you.  Other than that feature it is absolutely splitter.Graded as a route because I have no idea how one grades OW boulder problems, though I was wearing a beanie, which further complicates things.  It feels about a grade and a half harder than Chrysler Crack, so 9+/10-.No idea the name or FA.  Just posted to speed up the real info being found.# Location
As you approach and descend the base of the buttress you will pass a boulder just below the trail.  If you scramble to the underside of the boulder, you will find a heart shaped, blank face cleaved by a splitter OW crack.# Protection
