# Description
This route can be found just right of Prime Rib.  It climbs the obvious curving crack and then continues to the summit of the feature.  We know that the first pitch was previously climbed.  We discovered bolts at the top of the pitch and an old sling around a block.  We believe that we were the first to do the upper three pitches of the route.  However, anyone is welcome to dispute that fact.The route was named "Pricks and Ticks" because I had the unfortunate opportunity to fall into a cactus on the descent.  In addition to that, it seemed like we were battling an unusually large number of ticks throughout the day.Pitch 1 - Climb the beautiful arching crack up to a ledge.  Most of the crack is 5.7, but as it squeezes down and traverses, it becomes 5.9.  Belay at the double-bolt anchor. (160', 5.9)Pitch 2 - Climb up past a brushy ledge and onto the arete.  The black patina on the arete is similar to that found on Armatron or Going Nuts, but much less sustained.  As the rock quality deteriorates, step left onto a ledge and build a belay. (100', 5.7)Pitch 3 - Climb up a chimney up and right.  Continue to traverse right to a belay ledge at the base of a large corner. (75', 5.5)Pitch 4 - Climb up the corner to the summit.  More good black rock can be found on this spectacular pitch.  At the top, be sure to put in directionals so that the rope doesn't knock loose rock onto your partners. (160', 5.7)# Location
