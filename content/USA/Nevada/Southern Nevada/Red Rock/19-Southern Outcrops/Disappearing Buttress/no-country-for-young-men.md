# Description
The west end of the main south face is a steep varnished wall split by several cracks and fins. There is a small buttress separated from the face, forming a steep short gully between it and the wall.On the main wall above this detached buttress one can see a crack with mottled white patches on its left side. The upper, steepest portion of the crack has a small aromatic bush at its base. The route climbs this crack and follows another crack up more laid back terrain to the unroping spot, in three pitches.Start directly below the crack and climb a steep face to a broken area, passing the shrub and continuing to the abovementioned crack. Follow this feature to a comfortable belay  ledge, being careful with a precarious-looking block as one pulls onto the belay. (The first ascent party kicked and prodded this block to check its relative security. While it didn't move, it has a delicate look to it.) 180'Move to the left end of the ledge and climb a crack, clipping a ring wafer piton. Then, continue up  enjoyable rock with several short headwalls to a belay shy of the top. 190'Climb a short pitch, depending upon where the second belay was set up, to easy ground and the end of the route.Scramble up and west to broad ledges which lead over to the drainage, and descend to the base of the route.# Location
