# Description
This route would be a mega-classic if it were twice as long, but as it is, its a very nice route to test your mettle on at the end of the day. This route got its name after the FA party hauled its supplies to the top of the route, and then had to rap after one of us dropped a cam....Climb the corner to the ledge just above the corner. Descend climbers left from this ledge- there are no anchor opportunities on top of the formation.# Location
This beautiful splitter corner is located on the west face of the buttress. From the ledge system described in the descent, continue west, contouring north around the base of the buttress and up the hillside. At the top of the hillside, start looking up and right- the corner is VERY obvious. Some 4th class is required to get to the spacious belay ledge.# Protection
3x- .4,.5 BD or equivalent, 2x .75 BD or equivalent. A large offset nut and a red camalot are handy for the anchor.
