# Description
Adam's Rib takes a nice, smooth brown corner system a hundred yards up the hill from Prime Rib and just down from the start of Vanishing Act.Climb up a loose but easy face and corner to get to the good rock. Here, balance up below a small roof to clip the first of two bolts. I'll note that this is a reachy clip from an insecure stance and blowing it could easily result in injury (hence the R rating), but the rest of the climb is well protected.Now established in the good rock in the corner, clip a second bolt and climb a series of thin crimps with tricky footwork (cruxy fun) to gain better holds and more gear. Follow flakes up to a bolted anchor.# Location
# Protection
A single set of cams from 0.3 Camalot to #4 Camalot... You could get away without the #4 but it's nice to have. A few small stoppers. An 80m rope allows comfortable lowering but a 70 would probably work with careful down-climbing on easy ground.
