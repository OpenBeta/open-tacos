# Description
The best route on the cliff in my opinion.Start to the right and around the corner fromCombination CornerandSpinach, on the face left of Minute Maid crack.  Climb the featured dark varnished face past a series of horizontal breaks, which provide adequate protection possibilities.# Location
# Protection
A light rack of nuts and TCUs.  Rap from 2-bolt anchor or scramble up and right to rap from tree atop Minute Maid.
