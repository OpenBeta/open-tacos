# Description
Make a move or two off the deck before getting a hand sized piece in the horizontal. Continue up and past the vertical crack, placing small pieces at good stances. Once you're in the yellow rock the climbing eases significantly. Traverse right to the Short Cake anchors.I claimed this as an FA because there's nothing in the guidebook or on MP to suggest otherwise. If you know different, please correct me.# Location
This is the route that climbs the face/crack just right of the arete.# Protection
Single rack to number 1 or 2 Black Diamond. Micro cams might be nice.
