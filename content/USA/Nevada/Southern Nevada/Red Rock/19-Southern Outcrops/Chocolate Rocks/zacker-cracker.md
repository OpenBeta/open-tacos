# Description
This is a tough offwidth with an overhang halfway up. Pretty fun.Rappel with one rope from the anchor atop Mc-Crack-En.# Location
This is the off width in the gully to the left of Potzo's Pudding and Mc-Crack-En.# Protection
The crack looks like it'd need a couple #6 Camalots or equivalent Big Bros.Two #6's and a #5 are useful on this route. No Big Bros. were required.
