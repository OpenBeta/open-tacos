# Description
Start up a large spike of rock with an offwidth crack on its left side. From the top of the spike, jam up into the short chimney, then stem and chimney around the white chockstone that blocks the exit. There's some loose rock just below the chockstone.Guidebooks have traditionally rated this route at 5.6, but it's likely to be a rude shock for anyone expecting a casual warmup.# Location
The furthest right route at Chocolate Rocks, the obvious chimney about 50' uphill and right from Peanut Butter and Jam. Descend by scrambling off to the right; it would be easy to rappel from one of the jammed blocks at the top, but there's currently no anchor in place, so it would require leaving a cordelette and rings# Protection
Light rack to #5 Camalot, mostly fingers to thin hands. Sling blocks at top for anchor.
