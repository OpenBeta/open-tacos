# Description
The first pitch is amazing. Delicate, pumpy, steep and varied. The rest of the climb is quite a bit more moderate. Even still it makes for a fun adventure and a great cap to any day in sandstone canyon.P1- A V3 boulder problem protected by 2 bomber knifeblades leads to a bouldery and varied crack. Stop at a stance right where the the crack tops out or continue up the easy face to a small ledge about 60 ft up. 140 ft 5.11bP2- Easy face and crack leads up then left to the base of a massive, slabby left facing corner. 150 ft 5.6P3- Straight up the thin slabby corner, belay on a ledge right below the massive roof. 100 ft 5.8P4- Escape to the right and stretch your rope on easy slab. 200 ft 5.4P5- Continue up the ridge until you feel comfortable putting the rope away.Descent- Scramble up and right, aiming for the large tower shaped summit. Cut right down the scramblers gully at the base of the tower. 3/4th class slabs lead you back tot the wash.# Location
