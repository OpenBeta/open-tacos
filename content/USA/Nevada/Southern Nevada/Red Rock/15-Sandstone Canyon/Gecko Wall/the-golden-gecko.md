# Description
Climb a slightly right leaning crack for two pitches to the head wall at the top of the arch where the crack bends left. Climb the crack through the head wall, crux. From here the route wanders up the face on easier ground with less pro. A couple of these pitches brings you to a low-angle, right facing crack/dihedral and take this to the top.# Location
Begin in a right leaning crack that cuts through the black face below the left arch.# Protection
Double rack of cams up to #3, 1 #4 and a set of stoppers.
