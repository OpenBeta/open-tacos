# Description
Immediately to the left of Jubilant Song, there are a few bolts on the varnished face.  Two pitches up this face lead to a good ledge at the base of a left-facing dihedral.  Climb the dihedral to a good stance at its top.  The fourth pitch steps left, then climbs a corner past some protection bolts.  (For many years this was the route's high-point, the result of a blizzard-induced epic retreat.)  The fifth pitch goes up, then right, eventually following a small crack to to a hanging stance (on gear) beneath an overhanging headwall.  Climb the short headwall (5.9), then follow easy climbing on the path of least resistance for a pitch or two to the top of the wall.# Location
