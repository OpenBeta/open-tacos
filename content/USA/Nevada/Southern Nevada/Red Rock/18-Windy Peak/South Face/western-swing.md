# Description
About 50 feet down and right from the start of Jubilant Song is another right-facing dihedral.  Climb this for two pitches to a belay spot by a bush at the base of a flared chimney.  Climb the chimney until it squeezes down and arches to the right, then make a difficult swing move into the upper corner.  Set up a hanging belay a short distance above.  The fourth pitch traverses right to a weakness in the overhangs, then climbs up and left to a belay at the beginning of the big roof on Jubilant Song.  Join Jubilant Song for two pitches until established in the gully above the roof.  Instead of following the gully, climb the steep cracks on the wall to the left to the huge Bandstand Ledge on A Song and a Prayer.  One or two easy pitches lead to the top.# Location
