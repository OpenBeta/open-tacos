# Description
Start about 80 feet left of Windy Corner.  Face climb up and right, passing to the right of a bush, to a small left-facing corner in the clean white rock.  Pitch 2 starts by climbing up to the small roof, then move left and cross the roof (5.9) onto the varnished rock above.  Easier rock leads to a belay stance.  Continue up the dramatically corrugated buttress (rough, like a crocodile's back!) for about 200 feet to a belay position near Windy Corner.  Climb up about 40 feet and join Windy Corner where it moves right out of the main dihedral system.  Continue to the top on the upper pitches of Windy Corner.  Alternatively, the upper pitches of Hot Fudge Thursday are just a few feet farther right.# Location
