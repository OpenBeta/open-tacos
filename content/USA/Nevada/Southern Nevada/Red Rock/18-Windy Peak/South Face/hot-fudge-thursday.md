# Description
This route is a fun one.  The line is not particulary inspiring, but the climbing is good.  I am not sure if the "s" rating is too much, but there did seem to be a runout directly above the first belay.To locate the route look for a right slanting crack/seam that leaves a ledge near a tree.P1-(5.8) Follow the crack/seam up and right to a belay.  The climbing is really fun and engaging.P2-(5.9) Climb up towards some weird quarter inch bolts (runout).  Step to the right and follow a good crack up to a belay.P3-(5.8) Climb up apron (bolts) to a crack and steep face.P4-(5.4) Continue over blocky terrain.P5-(5.8) Climb up fragile rock (bolts and gear).P6-(5.8) Make a move around a corner and traverse left and up the ridge.# Location
# Protection
Standard rack.  I think all belays are bolted.
