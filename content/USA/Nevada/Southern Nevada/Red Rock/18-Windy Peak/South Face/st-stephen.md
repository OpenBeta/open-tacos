# Description
St. Stephen follows a wandering line immediately left of the huge left-facing corner system dominating the right side of the wall.  Not sustained enough to be classic, it offers some decent moderate climbing in a peaceful high setting.  Approach as for Jubilant Song.  This following route description is from the first ascent, which was done a few days after Solar Slab.Pitch 1 -- Follow thin cracks up the varnished, pretty slabs at the base of the wall.  Belay at a platform on a prominent ramp.Pitch 2 -- Continue up the ramp to belay in the main corner (5.8).Pitch 3 -- Instead of following the corner, climb a tight, left-slanting crack that splits the vertical face above (5.8).  This crack is a key feature of the route, visible from below.Pitches 4-8 -- Two easy pitches go out onto the face to the left.  Thin face climbing (5.8) bypasses a huge bulge on the left.  The final lead goes up obvious rock to the top.Descend via an easy hike.# Location
