# Description
Slabotomy is a nice short route that can be used either as an approach to Ain't No Saint or as a way to finish out the day.The first pitch can be found just left of the base of Ain't No Saint.  It follows a slightly rightward slanting crack up to a pair of bolts. (5.9)The second pitch climbs up past numerous bolts.  Some of these are quite old while others are a bit younger.  This pitch ends on a ledge at a second pair of bolts beneath the slab that one may use to access the second pitch of Ain't No Saint. (5.9)Rappel the route with double ropes or continue up Ain't No Saint.# Location
# Protection
Expect to use small cams and nuts in on the first pitch.  And expect to suppliment bolts with the same on the second.
