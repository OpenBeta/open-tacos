# Description
Lil' Sumpin' is a gently overhanging splitter offwidth corner that if existed in the Calico Hills would probably be a classic.  Unfortunately it has been gathering dust in the Attic of Red Rock and now is a little unusual to seek out on its own.  That being said the quality is quite good, climbing challenging, and setting peaceful, if not just a little sandy.# Location
Prominent white corner crack 2/3rds up the hillside and roughly across canyon from "A Nasty Gash"  Please reference photos and binoculars might be helpful before questing up the hill.# Protection
Something similar to #4, two #5, #6 and a couple beers. Think steep calf/knee crack.
