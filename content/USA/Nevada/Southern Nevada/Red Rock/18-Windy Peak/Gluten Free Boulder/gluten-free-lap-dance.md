# Description
The climb starts in a thin left facing corner with good gear. Stemming and creative use of face holds move you into the crack with solid jams in the corner to get over the small roof to a comfortable stance. Small gear protects a couple thin finger jams as you move up through the short chimney. Continue following the crack as it curves overhead and to the right under a roof on medium sized gear and jams. Scramble to the top of the formation and walk off to climbers left.We built an anchor in the final 1-3" crack and lowered from there in order to clean the gear, then we scrambled up the backside to clean the anchor and walked off.# Location
This climb is found on a south facing rock feature in the area below the south side of Windy Peak. If you are on the approach to Windy Peak it can be found as you get into the the large terraced area above the main creek/gully below the large swaths of slab.# Protection
Standard rack to 3". Small gear emphasized.
