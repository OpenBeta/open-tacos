# Description
A fun trip up hollow rock, with aesthetics typical of beautiful varnished Red Rock sandstone. Might be pg13 or R; I got plenty of gear but recall some gongy thin flakes that flexed quite a bit and were the best spots available for pro.# Location
When descending Jackass Flats or any of the other routes on Windy Peak East Face, this route is just right of the spot where the gully flattens out-look for an attractive chocolate flake/crack climb. Descend with a 60m rope to the right from fixed mank or scramble off down the familiar gully to the right.# Protection
Funky but frequent, I used up to a #3 camalot
