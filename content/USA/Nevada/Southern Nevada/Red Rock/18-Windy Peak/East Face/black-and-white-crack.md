# Description
Climb the crack-chimney system in two pitches, belaying wherever it makes sense. The rock is mostly quite solid, and very featured. Despite the modest grade, it's very much a rock climb, not just a scramble.# Location
Around the corner right of the Diet Delight area, scramble up about 100' to a stance below a vertical chimney-crack system in a big left-facing corner. The left wall is mostly black varnish and the right wall is mostly white, hence the name. A large square-cut overhang is just to the left of the base of the corner. Descend by going up and right over a notch, traversing, and descending a long gully (not the first, steep one, but the wider one beyond it). The descent is time-consuming, and probably more of an adventure than the climb.# Protection
Standard rack to 3"
