# Description
Test Tube is an outstanding handcrack and chimney climb.Pitch one goes up the obvious corner system with juggy holds on the sides. Soon, the rock becomes glass-like, and the only feature left is a killer hand crack that widens into a chimney.Pitches two and three continue up the chimney to the top of the pillar. These pitches are about 80 feet each.Rappel the route to the right, Spare Rib, with one 60m rope.# Location
Test Tube is in the prominent right-facing dihedral about 30 feet left of Spare Rib and about 100 yards left of Crimson Chrysalis.# Protection
Bring a generous rack for the first pitch with an emphasis on #0.75 to #2 Camalots. We didn't need anything larger than a #3 on any pitch of this climb. There is no fixed gear or bolts.
