# Description
So there is a burly crack in Red Rocks!  Tiger Crack is a demanding pitch that calls upon a variety of skills.Begin by schwacking through some scrub oak to a dirty little belay below a lichenous, low-angle hand crack in an alcove - this is just left of Crimson and immediately left of the obvious corner of Clod Tower.P1: Climb up the junky hand crack to a bolted belay atop a pedestal.  5.6 or so and totally doable in your Five Tennies.P2: Three bolts of fingery climbing lead up an odd series of sidepulls and liebacks.  Certainly the crux for me but you crack-deprived Red Rocks locals might find this section relatively easy.  Footwork is key, but once you move right to the crack itself there is a rest.  Continue up the crack which is steep and leaning all the wrong ways.  Size changes and several cruxes ensure a solid pump.  Up higher you may be glad to have brought a #5 or #6 Camalot to protect a difficult move out of a wide section, but even after this very overhanging hand jams will keep you fighting right to the end. Some awkward moves up the dirty corner on the right or, more directly, sketchy moves up a final loose face lead to an anchor.# Location
