# Description
This challenging and aesthetic route can be found on the left side of the Cloud Tower, just right of the Clod Tower route. It shares the first pitch with the Clod Tower, but then breaks right soon after to gain the obvious dihedral system off right. It follows this for 4 pitches before being forced into the gully at the top of the Clod Tower. From here, finish as for the Clod TowerThis route is named in memory of a good friend and mentor- JR Thompson (1953-2006)# Location
This route starts just left of Crimson Chrysalis in the obvious large recess with an arching crack up high (Tiger Crack). 4th class until you reach a ledge, then ascend the back of the recess in a beautiful crack just right of Tiger Crack's second pitch.# Protection
Double rack to 4", 5" optional.
