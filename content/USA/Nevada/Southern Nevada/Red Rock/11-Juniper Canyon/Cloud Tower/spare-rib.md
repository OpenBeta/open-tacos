# Description
This is a really neat route and a good option if Crimson is crowded and you need to kill an hour or two. It's also worthy of the hike by itself, especially if pair with a trip up Test Tube or Pachyderm.About 100 yards east of Crimson is a small buttress with a prominent varnished corner on its left-hand side. Just to the right of this corner at the base is a striking finger crack- this is your route.Pitch 1: Head up the finger crack through a bulge to the belay. 5.8, 85'Pitch 2: Step left off the belay and follow bolts and pro to the next belay. 5.7, 85'Pitch 3: Head straight up on somewhat easy ground, following the bolts to a hanging belay. 5.6, 85'Pitch 4: Head straight up to the summit on 4th class terrain.Descent: Rap the route with a single rope.# Location
