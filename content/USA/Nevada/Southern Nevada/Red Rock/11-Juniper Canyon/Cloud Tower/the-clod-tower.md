# Description
This is a little done route that sits just left of Crimson Chrysalis. Start in the large recess just left of Crimson Chrysalis- 4th class up the gully until it makes sense to rope up.Head up the crack above to a decent stance just below where the crack splits. The Clod Tower heads up the left hand crack system for several pitches, ultimately gaining the top of the 'Mushroom'- a large red ledge system down and left from the summit of Crimson Chrysalis.The crack system to the right is the Disciple.# Location
Start about 100' left of Crimson in an obvious recess. This route lies just right of Tiger Crack, an obvious, arching 5.12 in the recess. From the top, the best option is probably to rappel onto Crimson using 2 ropes.# Protection
A good sized rack through 4", 5" optional
