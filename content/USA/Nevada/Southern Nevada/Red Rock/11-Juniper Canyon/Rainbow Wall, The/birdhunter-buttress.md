# Description
The route ascends the right side of the Rainbow wall. Fun climbing on all pitches with some spicy face moves for the crux. Look under vegetation for bolts. Good full day adventure on some infrequently traveled stone. Also great views of the Rainbow wall.History: Joanne Urioste was nice enough to write a story about their epic first ascent experience!

# Protection
A single set of gear is fine with a few extra runners and/or QD's as there are more bolts (nice old bolts) than you think.
