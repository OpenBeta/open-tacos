# Description
Left Edge is the leftmost route on the Jungle Wall, and despite the bouldery start is, perhaps, the best warmup available.  A beautiful, but reachy and committing, sequence up the arÃªte leads to enjoyable face climbing.# Location
# Protection
8 bolts.  Some run outs on easier climbing can be protected with stoppers or small cams.
