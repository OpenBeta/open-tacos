# Description
Jungle Gym would be a great route anywhere else, but sandwiched between two classics, and with slightly lower-quality rock, it doesn't quite stack up.Begin to the left in a corner feature, place a 0.75 Camalot and traverse straight right to more gear and a bolt - in order to prevent rope drag, I'd suggest backcleaning that 0.75 or soloing to this point.  Continue up steep rock and gear placements to an anchor high on the wall.# Location
# Protection
A double set of small Aliens and nothing larger than a 0.75 Camalot.
