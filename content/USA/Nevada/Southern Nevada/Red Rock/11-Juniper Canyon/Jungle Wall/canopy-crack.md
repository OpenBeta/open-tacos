# Description
Climb the double finger cracks off the ground (stay in the left one for better rock and more fun). Continue jamming up a multitude of sizes until climbing on top of a dusty ledge.Â  Either build a belay here or....Climb the offwidth/chimney at the back of the ledge.Plug gear in the crack at the back of the imposing roof. The crack in the roof is tight, but there is a miraculous lip that allows you to layback across the face, and climb around the roof (Crux).(5.9 Variation.) Instead of doing the roof moves, stem to the outside of the alcove, and climbers left onto the face.Continue up the crack above to an anchor above.# Location
First crack left of the evergreen at the base of Mowgli.# Protection
Doubles .2-2. Single to 4. The smallest c3, or perhaps some ballnuts, could be used to take the spice out of the roof, but won't be needed by stronger parties.
