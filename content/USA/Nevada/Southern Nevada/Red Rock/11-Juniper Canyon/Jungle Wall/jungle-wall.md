# Description
Jungle Wall is the second route on the wall climbers' right. The first bolt is about 25 feet off the deck but the climbing to get to it is easy. Climb up the wall for about 100 feet on 5.9 terrain until it starts getting thin and you're at the crux. Do some power slabbin for a few moves and catch a good rest.After the rest you're pretty much in there. Finish up on a little more friable rock and rap from the chains with two 60 meter ropes.# Location
Second route on the climbers' right. Rap with two ropes.# Protection
12 draws for the route and 2 for the anchor.
