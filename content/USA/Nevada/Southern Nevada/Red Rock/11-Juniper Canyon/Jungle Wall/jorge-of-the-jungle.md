# Description
Left of Canopy Crack is a pillar, with a steep offwidth crack between it and the wall.  Chimney up, plug a cam near the top, and get on up.  From here walk to the center of the pillar, and start heading up the juggy varnish, using mostly horizontals for gear.  You are working toward the obvious feature, a miniature right facing corner that leads to a seam and thin crack.Follow this feature until the climbing naturally leads you right to Canopy crack, where you will climb the last section of that route to a shared anchor.70m may get you down. 80m definitely would.# Location
25 feet left of Mowgli is a pillar. Climb the right side of the pillar and then up from the center  of the pillar.# Protection
All the tiny stuff you own.  Aliens and C3's do well on this one.Cams to 3 plus nuts.Be prepared for lots of small pieces of protection on generally solid, varnished rock.
