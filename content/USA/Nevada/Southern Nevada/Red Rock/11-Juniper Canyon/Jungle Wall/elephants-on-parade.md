# Description
Pitch 1: (10a 100') Runout face climbing on solid varnish until reaching the right slanting crack. Climb the crack until level with the ledge. Traverse left and belay on ledge.Pitch 2: (10a 100') Use the anchor as your first piece, grab the rail, and smear and mantle up. Run it out to the thin crack. Climb straight up the crack to a fixed anchor.Pitch 3: (5.9-) Climb the crack into the corner, stemming and pulling on jugs to mitigate the steepness. Follow the corner to the top.This climb is very straightforward, with an obvious set of features to guide you, but is enjoyable, especially the 3rd pitch.Raps cleanly with a 60m rope.# Location
