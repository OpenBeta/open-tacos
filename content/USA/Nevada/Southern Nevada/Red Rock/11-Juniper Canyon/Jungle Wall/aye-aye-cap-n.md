# Description
An Aye-Aye is a confused looking creature you may find in the Jungle at night. It is the largest nocturnal primate and has 1 hillarious looking finger.This climb runs up the crack, but being Red Rock you end up using the crack for protection and face holds and huecos to ascend.  The rock is bomber, the pro is solid. The one short section of white rock runout is far below the grade.It's steep, straightforward route finding, and ends above a nice roof pull.Originally this line was climbed to the top in 7 pitches, ending just below Luxor Wall at dusk. We took in one of the best views in the park. Then we rapped out looking like a couple of Aye-Ayes. Oh, and I had 1 hillarious looking Finger.You should just climb the 1st pitch and rap/top rope. You're probably not ready to go all the way.# Location
Leftmost crack in a very obvious alcove of chimneys.After passing Little Britches either climb the giant boulder, tunnel directly under, or take scrambling path right and around.# Protection
Doubles to 3. Add a 4. Add a 3rd #2 if you want (final crux is perfect #2 jams and cams).Lower off.
