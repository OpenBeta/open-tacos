# Description
A parasitic toprope, feeding off the neighboring climb and its anchor. Attractive and techy, this face climb will make your sport climbing friends say "That was the best pitch of the day" because they have no idea what they're talking about.Crimps and balancey moves, best ended where the climb slabs out, or send it to the top and help clean out that chossy crack above.# Location
Varnished face left of Aye-Aye, aiming for that one hueco on the left up there.# Protection
Toprope off the Aye-Aye anchor.
