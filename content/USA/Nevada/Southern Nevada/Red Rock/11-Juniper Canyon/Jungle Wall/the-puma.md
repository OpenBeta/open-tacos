# Description
Leftmost climb off the Cougar Ledge.  Climb up large holds, plug a #4 cam in a perfect sized hueco, and keep your wits about you.  Climb up and slightly right, snag a jug, find the good feet, get some more gear in.  Now head up and left, to the really good gear, get it in, and hear your belayer exhale.  Follow the crack to the top, and a shared anchor with The Panther.# Location
Left side of the Cougar Ledge.# Protection
You could get away with .2-4 and nuts, but triple .2 and double .3-.5 will be a little more comfy.
