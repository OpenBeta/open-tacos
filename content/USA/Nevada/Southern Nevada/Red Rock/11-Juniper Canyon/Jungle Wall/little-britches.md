# Description
Probably the most enjoyable 5.8 I have done in the park.Double cracks that start in a stembox. Follow the tracks to the anchor in the alcove.# Location
A few hundred feet uphill from Mowgli. Very obvious feature.# Protection
Cams and nuts. .3-3 with extras in the finger size. Extra #2 helps as well.
