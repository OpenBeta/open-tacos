# Description
Crack system immediately left of Little Britches.Climb starts with small, mediocre pro. Key holds are hidden pockets. It doesn't slab out as fast as you think it will.Nice varnished feet disappear quickly, but allow the placement of cams in the right facing sidepull and in the shallow pocket above. Work up to a hard to see pocket, and the rest is enjoyable fun movement, and locker jams in the crack.Lower from the anchor or climb up and traverse left to join the last pitch of Elephants on Parade. Either way a 60m gets you down.# Location
Just left of Little Britches.# Protection
Double .2-1.  Add .2, .3, 2, 3, nuts.
