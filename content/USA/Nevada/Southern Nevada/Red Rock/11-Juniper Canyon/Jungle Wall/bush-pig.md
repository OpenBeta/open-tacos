# Description
Start in a seam and climb 20 feet to thin ledge.  Easily traverse left to the chocolate offset corner.  (Or climb directly up from below the offset with spaced pro.)  Plug .4 in a horizontal and make your way up the offset, and then slightly left. Pull over a bulge and into some white rock and stem your way up to a nice stance below a large bulge at maybe 75'.From here traverse slightly left on the varnished ledge, and then climb up on bomber jugs, following the crack for protection.  Things thin out, but the rock quality does not.  Spaced out crimps, huecos and jams get you to the top, for an excellent stance and trucker anchor.Raps with an 80m.# Location
Just below and left of the big arch.  The chocolate offset corner is a nice feature to look for.# Protection
Singles to 3, double .2-.5.  Lots of nuts.  Keep your head on a swivel near the top.
