# Description
Crack climbing with lots of face holds to keep it mild.Either climb from the ground or the top of the boulder pile.  Plug a piece or 2 and walk up the slabby section.  The climb gets real right away with a bulging transition followed by vertical crack climbing of various sizes.I placed a #5 camalot at the bulge but would have made do with a #4 if I had one.# Location
Just right of Little Britches.# Protection
Single rack to 4 at minimum.  I placed every size .2-5, and an extra .5 and .75. I didnt have a 4 but could have placed it twice.
