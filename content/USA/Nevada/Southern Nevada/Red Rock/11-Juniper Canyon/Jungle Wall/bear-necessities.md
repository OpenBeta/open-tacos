# Description
Climb either from the ground up the corner right of Jungle Wall, or start on top of the tower where Jungle Gym begins.  Climb, jam, and stem up great rock, eventually ending up right at Jungle Gym's bolted anchor.# Location
The obvious crack left of Jungle Gym.# Protection
Singles .4-6.  Extra 1-3 if you need it. No nuts for me.
