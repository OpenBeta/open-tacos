# Description
This is a fantastic crack that would be dripping with chalk if it was a little closer to the road.  The crack looks to be a finger crack from afar but is actually a varied crack up to 4" on bomber black varnish.  Move up and diagonally until you reach a bush.  Go either way around the bush and continue straight up a a crack to the apex of the pyramid.  Fun!!!# Location
This is the obvious left leaning crack on the righthand side of the Luxor Wall.To descend you can do 4th class downclimbing to the south side of the formation or do a rope stretching rappel from black slings just below the lip with a 60m rope.# Protection
Nuts, cams, and perhaps tricams to 3".  Be careful as the crack flares inside.
