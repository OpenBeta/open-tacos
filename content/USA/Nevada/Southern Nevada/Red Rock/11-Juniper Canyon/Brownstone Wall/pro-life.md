# Description
Pro Life is a great pitch of thin face climbing on some of the most bullet-proof varnish Red Rocks has to offer. Well protected and excellent. Done on it's own, probably 2 stars (as is Pro Choice), but when combined with that route the outing is a 3 star day. Pro Life is definitely the better of the two lines.P1-3: Begin with the first 2-3 pitches (depending on how you pitch it out) of Pro Choice (see that route's description).P4 (150', 5.12b): Start up Pro Choice's final pitch and climb through its crux (5.11a), but where that route moves left into the easy corner, instead step right clipping a bolt to reach a stance at the base of the immaculate, blunt arete. Climb up this through two distinct, thin cruxes protected by three more bolts, ultimately continuing up, or just left of, an easier crack to a bolted anchor on a big ledge.Pictured on the guidebook cover.# Location
# Protection
Single set to 1.5" is adequate. An 80 meter rope will allow you to rap back down to the Party Ledge.
