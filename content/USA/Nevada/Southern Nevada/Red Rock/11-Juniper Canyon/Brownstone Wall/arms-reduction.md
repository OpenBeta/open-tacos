# Description
Arms Reduction is a refreshing variation to the overbolted lower pitches of Armatron.  It climbs up surprisingly fun moves on good rock that protects reasonably too.  Perhaps I am a little biased but I feel it is better climbing in better style than Armatron's lower pitches.Pitch 1, 195ft, 5.9 -Begin by face climbing up 15ft to a moon shaped arching crack.  Move up the crack.  As the crack starts to arch left move rightward out of the crack onto the face.  Above the moon-shaped feature are two left leaning parallel cracks.  Continue up and right to the rightmost of the parallel cracks.  Continue up this crack until you reach a small sloping ledge for a belay.Pitch 2, 160ft, 5.9  Move straight up the crack into the chimney on nice huecos.  When you reach a bush move out left onto the chocolate face.  Move straight up the featured face until you reach a small ledge with the Armatron anchors to your left.Pitch 3 Rappel or continue up the boltless upper pitch of Armatron for another pitch of good climbing.# Location
This route starts about 50ft right of (bolted)Armatron.  Look for an obvious arching crack to the right of dark rock.Rappel Armatron.# Protection
