# Description
The broad reddish face to the right of Black Dagger is split by an obvious crack.  Climb up and right to the right side of a prominent overhang.  The second pitch starts by the far right edge of the roof at a crack.  Climb up until an easy traverse left leads to the main crack system.  Follow this for a few pitches to slabs at the top of the wall.  The upper overhangs pose no serious difficulties.  Descend by walking south (left) and scrambing down through the Gunsight Notch.Routefinding note: on the second pitch there is a bolt some distance above the roof.  It is probably easier to skip this bolt and make the leftward traverse a bit lower on good face holds.# Location
