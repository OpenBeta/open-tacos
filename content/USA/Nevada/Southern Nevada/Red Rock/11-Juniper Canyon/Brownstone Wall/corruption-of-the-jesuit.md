# Description
Corruption of the Jesuit is a fun pitch of thin, off-balance climbing on nice rock. I don't think it's quite as good as its neighbor, Immaculate Conception, but it is definitely worth doing if you're in the area.Approach via either the first three pitches of Pro Choice (recommended) or Senior Dimensions (not recommended) and set up your base camp on the Party Ledge. Continue up the 4th pitch of Senior Dimensions (the short left-facing corner) to a bolted anchor at a small stance. Consider bringing a pair of quicklinks and rings to improve this anchor.Climb up a crack above the belay. Thin climbing past two bolts leads up and slightly left to gain a leaning, right facing flake. The gear in this flake is a bit tricky and placing it feels a bit touch and go, but it is confidence inspiring when you get it - just be patient and hold on! The climbing through this entire section will keep you on your toes until you finally reach huge holds where the difficulties abruptly relent. Continue up easier face climbing (passing a few portable holds near the top) that ultimately lands you at a bolted anchor shared with Pro Life on a ledge out left.Descending back to the belay from here is no problem, but if you want to return all the way to the Party Ledge make sure you have either an 80m rope or two ropes.# Location
Start from the Party Ledge atop P3 of Pro Choice or Senior Dimensions and continue up the short P4 of the latter.# Protection
