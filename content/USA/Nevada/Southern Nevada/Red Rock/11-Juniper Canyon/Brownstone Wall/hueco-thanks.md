# Description
Hueco Thanks climbs the left of two prominent crack/chimney systems in the Sand Castle face. It's a gentle trad romp to the summit of the sand castle subsidiary face, with an easy single-rap descent down Ten Minute Shift.p1) start on the far left side of the Armatron slab. 3rd class a few yards left to a stance in a dish and belay there. climb left and up through intricate routefinding to the chimney. belay at a good stance at the bush. ~170', ~5.7Note: you can do a more aesthetic, and more direct, first pitch by starting up the first pitch of Sand Castle and stepping left to the bush/chimney belay, but it is distinctly harder.p2) chimney up, past the overhang (route crux), and continue up the crack to belay beneath an alcove. ~120', ~5.7p3) stem up the steep alcove and follow the crack up a juggy hueco'd pitch to the top. belay easiest with thin-hand size cams. ~160', ~5.7# Location
Descent: walk climber's left along the ledge to the small pine tree and a bolt. five short single rope rappels down Ten Minute Shift take you to the ground. 50m rope ok for the rappels.# Protection
Rack: double nuts, lots of slings, and single green alien to #3 camalot.
