# Description
This route ascends the obvious dihedral about 150' to the right of Nightcrawler. The climbing is fun and varied, but the last two pitches are best avoided due to the deteriorating quality of the rock.# Location
Start 150' right of Nightcrawler on an easy slab below an obvious roof about 200' up. The best option for descent is to rappel Pro Choice, accessed from near the top of the 5th pitch. Bring two ropes. Otherwise, go to the top, then head south and west to the Gunsight.# Protection
Gear to 4" is fine, extra small and medium stuff. Some pro bolts and one bolted anchor.
