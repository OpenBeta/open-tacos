# Description
Start by traversing out onto a slopey varnished ledge to gain the corner. From here set a belay anchor (recommended) using micro nuts.  Climb up through tricky lay backing then into slightly easier climbing when feet appear.  Negotiate an offwidth section and place your last gear before the slab chimney runout to a large slung horn.This route could continue upwards for another easier pitch before running into the upper pitches of One-Arm Bandit.# Location
There is a large varnished wall to the left of Olive Oil with two corners facing each other.  This route goes up the longer left facing corner.# Protection
Single rack to 3", one 5" before a runout to the top.
