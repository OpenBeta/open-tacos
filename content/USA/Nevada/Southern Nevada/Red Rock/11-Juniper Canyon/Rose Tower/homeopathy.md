# Description
A great follow up to Olive Oil if you have the energy.Pitch1: Climb a short but sweet hand crack through a roof and into a rocky gully. Getting up into the crack can be tricky, considering the roof starts right off the deck. My buddy had to stack two rocks and stand on them to follow me. Belay on chalkstones/bouldersPitch 2: Directly opposite the finish for the last pitch there's a nice looking flake. Layback/tight jam the crack up through a great pitch. Belay with a couple of cams far back on the ledge you gain.Descent. Go up from the last belay to a large pine tree. There was a sling with a rap ring on it when we climbed it (10/2010) this deposits you a few hundred feet right of where you started# Location
A few hundred feet right of the gully that leads to the start of Olive Oil. Look through bushes to find the right crack/roof combo (there are many there, look for the one that seems to have the best hand jam potential).# Protection
standard rack, heavy on the #.75-#2 camalots
