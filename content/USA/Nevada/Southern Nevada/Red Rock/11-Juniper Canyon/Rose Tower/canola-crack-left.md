# Description
What's the next best thing after olive oil?  At the very top of the Olive Oil descent gully, there are two clean, aesthetic cracks in the darkly varnished face.  Both are in the 5.7 to 5.8 range.# Location
As you begin the descent from Olive Oil, these cracks are immediately to your right, at the top of the gully.# Protection
