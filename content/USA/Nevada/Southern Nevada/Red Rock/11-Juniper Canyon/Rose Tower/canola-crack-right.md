# Description
A nice crack with a moderate approach but can be a nice afternoon jaunt to top off Olive Oil.# Location
Go up the Olive Oil Descent Gulley.  At the top of the gulley to climber's left there is a nice varnished wall with two nice cracks.  This is the right of those two cracks.  You can walk off to the climber's right.# Protection
Standard rack will get you to the top but be prepared to build your own anchor in cracks at top.
