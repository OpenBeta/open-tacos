# Description
A great, easy romp with 5 quality, consistent pitches. Start well around the left side of Rose Tower, up a gully of sorts at the base of a big corner/ramp.P1: Begin at a rounded buttress just up and left from a deep recess. Climb slabby rock with sparse pro to a narrow alcove with a sandy floor and huecoed wall.P2 & 3 (link): Climb straight up nice, exposed cracks just right of the major, right-facing corner, and then step back left into the corner at the top, promptly arriving at a cramped belay perch. This pitch is 200' long.P4: From the belay on the ledge to the left, traverse right 10 feet, follow juggy rock up and into a left-facing corner (or stay on the face). Continue up, being careful not to go too high, and move around to the right to a spacious belay ledge.P5: Climb up off the belay at a weakness and traverse right again across a slab and up into a dihedral. Continue up this until it ends, then scramble off right and up to the top.Descent: From the summit scramble off the back of the tower (two short downclimbs may require a spot). From here drop down and right into the Olive Oil Descent Gully (the gully to climber's right of The Rose Tower). Follow this all the way down.# Location
