# Description
On the right (western) side of the Aquarium Wall, there is a very clean corner that leads toward an unpromising slab.  Delightful climbing ascends the corner to a stance where the crack widens to hand size.  Pitch 2 follows the crack to its end, then frictions up and left to another crack, eventually belaying beneath a steeper section.  Three more pitches go up the crack system to the top.# Location
Approach as for the Aquarium Wall.  After climbing throught the tunnel, continue up the gully until you can cross left beneath the obvious opening corner.# Protection
