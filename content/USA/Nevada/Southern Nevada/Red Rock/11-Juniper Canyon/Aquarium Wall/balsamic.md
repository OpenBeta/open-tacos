# Description
The steep wide crack with black varnish insides through a bulge. Wild and fun and a lot easier than it looks - but you better know what a chicken wing is!# Location
About 50 yds above Olive Oil, there's a bushy ledge that leads over to the Aquarium wall. Balsamic climbs the obvious crack, starting on hueco'd face up to a constriction, then up the gaping crack above. Once past the overhang, climb up the easy face to the right of the big chimney, belay on a ledge, then scramble up past a short easy 5th chimney to the rappel tree.# Protection
Pro to 3", plus one or two 10-12" (i.e. #4 Big Bros). Also a thin sling  (single shoulder length fine) is needed to tie off a cool 3/4" diameter hole through the rock before the crux. 90' rap off a big tree into the gully.
