# Description
Votive offerings to the ship's namesake may provide the wisdom and technical ability required to ascend this pitch. Starts with big holds and sparse gear placements. The gear gets better as the climb progresses, but expect to tack left and right to find it.# Location
The logical topout for The Black Pearl/Swine Tasting or Saddle Up. At the center of amphitheater above these climbs is a black face that does not overhang; The Minerva climbs the intially blunt arete at the left side of the face and, higher up, the left side of the black face.# Protection
Modern rack, black alien to blue camalot (#3), slings; double ropes helpful.
