# Description
Jake Burkey told me about this route some time ago.  I believe that he and a friend first climbed it in 1997 or 1998.This route can be found on the left side of the small tower described in the piece on "Don't Touch that in Front of Grandma." The route can be found on Jackrabbit Buttress directly across from "Olive Oil."The route works its way up a chimney to the top of the "Cottontail Tower."  Burkey claimed that the route continued for another pitch, but we only went to the top of the tower.# Location
