# Description
A nice pitch goes up the pleasantly varnished and featured chimney to a belay position in a small alcove.  The second pitch continues up the steep crack on somewhat softer and less pleasant rock.  Pitch three frictions up to a left-slanting ramp.  The route finishes on easier slabs above.# Location
The route starts in the obvious chimney about twenty feet left (west) ofErnest Stemmingway.# Protection
