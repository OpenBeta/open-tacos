# Description
This obscure line starts 300 yds. left(south) around the corner from Geronimo. It starts with a dark right facing corner, eventually passing through a roof and stopping at a incredibly, black varnished face(300'). Up this blank face a pitch or two, and meet up with the final pitch of Geronimo. I know I have a topo around here somewhere, and will post it once I find it. A fun, albeit runout route if you find Geronimo is a bit too busy, as we did.Descend as for Geronimo.# Location
