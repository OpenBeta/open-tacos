# Description
Up the crack, up the face above to a belay at the headwall. Tiptoe up this on flakes and trend left to the obvious, wide crack. Up this (# 5 camalot?) and then ramble to the top of the formation.Next, leap from the top formation onto wall behind. Continue up Myster Z or head left and up Buffon's Needle Problem/Rose Hips. Alternately, head up and right a short pitch to a down-climb into a down-climb gully.This climb would benefit from traffic after a soaking rain to clean the fragile flakes. Once trafficked, the climb will be delightful.# Location
The right leaning crack system(s) that start halfway down the hillside between Myster Z and the trail.# Protection
Normal rack. A #5 Camalot might be in order for pitch 2.
