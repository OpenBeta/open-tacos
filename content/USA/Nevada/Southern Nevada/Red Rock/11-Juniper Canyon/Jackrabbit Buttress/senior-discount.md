# Description
Left Stick's soul mate; a delight for connoisseurs of slightly overhung, wide #3 camalot cracks. Would deserve many stars if it were longer and one could casually scramble to the base of the crack/dihedral.# Location
On the right side of the gully between Geronimo and Mr Z; the all too obvious short, wide, gently overhanging crack in a tight corner.# Protection
The crack proper starts as red camalots and the business is #3 camalots. A #4 can be placed eventually. Purple & green camalots (.5 & .75) useful for belay above & below.
