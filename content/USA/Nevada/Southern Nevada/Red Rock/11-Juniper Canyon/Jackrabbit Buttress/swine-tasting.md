# Description
Follow discontinuous cracks and huecos up to the right end of a black, varnished roof. Traverse left to the arête proper and pull through to discontinuous cracks and easier climbing on the arête and face above. From the (climber's) right side of the ledge system (where The Black Pearl tops out), climb up and right to the obvious crack.  Follow it up and left ~ 60 feet, gaining 3rd/4th class rock. Angle up and left to a short, awkward finger/hand crack that leads to a wider crack and the short hike to the Jackrabbit buttress descent cairns.# Location
The arête between Blind Spot and The Black Pearl. Start 30 feet downhill from the Black Pearl. Descend pitch 1 by rappel from trees at (climber's) left end of ledge system; descend from the top via Jackrabbit Buttress walk off.# Protection
Nuts, doubles blue camalot jr. to blue camalot useful to gain the buttress top in one pitch. A few long slings may be in order to manage rope drag for the traverse below the varnished roof. A #5 camalot fits nicely in a hueco at the start of this traverse.
