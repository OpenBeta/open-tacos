# Description
This route was originally done in 1998, but for some reason never found itself in a guidebook."Stuffed Animals on Prozac" can be found directly across from Olive Oil.  Approach as you would for Olive Oil, but take the first real trail to the left as you enter the canyon.  Skirt the base of the cliff to bottom of the route on Jackrabbit Buttress.Once you are at the base of the route, you will see a line of bolts that leads into a crack system.  Climb past the bolts into the crack and continue up to the belay.  The first pitch is 5.8.  From the belay, follow the beautiful 5.7 crack system to the top of the second pitch.  Rappel the route with double ropes.# Location
