# Description
No crux, just 50 feet of squirming--as offwidths go, this one is delightful.# Location
An approach pitch gains the belay nook at the base of the crack in the left facing corner on the left side of the Senior Discount block. On the right side of the gulley between Myster Z and Geronimo.# Protection
The business is #5 & #6 Camalots and wider; two of each might be handy. Plus one of blue camalot jr. to #4 camalot.
