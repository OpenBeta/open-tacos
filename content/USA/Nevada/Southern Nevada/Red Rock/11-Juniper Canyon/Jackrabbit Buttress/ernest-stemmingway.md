# Description
Start at the deep, varnished chimney.  Climb the outer edge of the varnish, getting occasional protection with small wired nuts.Pitch 2 continues up the crack system as it turns into a forbidding offwidth.  Stemming holds and a big cam make this pitch more reasonable than it first appears.  After the offwidth turns into a chimney, work out a belay where you can find good anchor potential.Pitch 3 finishes the crack, then presents a choice.  The easier route is to follow the left branch, which turns into a good ramp.  The right branch leads to an offwidth grovel, then easier climbing.Pitch 4: From the top of the ramp, go up easy slabs and cracks.Pitch 5: easy climbing leads to the unroping spot.Descend by walking west, toward the Brownstone Wall, then hike down Juniper Canyon.# Location
This route is on the south face of the Jackrabbit Buttress, a short distance upstream from Rose Hips. Hike into Juniper Canyon until you can thread a way through the boulders and brush to the base of the wall.# Protection
