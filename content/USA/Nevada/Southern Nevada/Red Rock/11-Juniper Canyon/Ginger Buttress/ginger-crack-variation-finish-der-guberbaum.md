# Description
This is a new-to-me finish that is more in line, literally and figuratively, with the rest of the climbing on Ginger Cracks. Upon finishing P5 of Ginger Cracks, continue up the corner system into the bushy gully. The route "Blade Runner" will be on your right but you're aiming for the smooth, varnished corner dead ahead.Begin with perfect #2 & #3 Camalot hand jams up to the roof using a cool ledge to chimney with your back against the right wall. Place pro out in the flake of the right wall and make a move to get into the broken flake system. Continue up and over the overhang into the corner using the crack and face holds. Continue up the corner until you can converge with the chimney finish of Ginger Cracks. Bust left onto the face when appropriate and finish at a rock pinch.# Location
To the right of the 5.7 finish of Ginger Cracks in a large, obvious corner.# Protection
Single Rack from #1 C3 to #3 Camalot. Most climbers will feel comfortable bumping a #2 Camalot with them for the first 30' or so.
