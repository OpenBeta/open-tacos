# Description
All You Can Eat is a fine rock climb that appeases all the types of climbers out there. The smooth corners that make up the first two pitches are a rarity in Red Rock and satisfy those looking to climb some good, splitter crack. It shares the same first half of Power Failure's first pitch. Look for the bolt.Approach Pitch: This can easily be soloed or rope up if you want. Start at the 1st pitch of Power Failure up to the first bolt. Pull onto the ledge and walk climber's right to a obtuse corner crack system.There are two options for the first pitch. Both are high quality and engaging.Pitch 1.a: Start out in the adjacent crack to the left of the obtuse right facing crack and traverse back into the crack above the 2nd bolt. The Direct goes straight up through both bolts and goes at 5.11d. The 11d is comprised of holds facing "the wrong way" and some longer reaches to better holds. The crux is low on the left crack. Strenuous liebacking and a thrilling step across move leads back into the main crack. Once above the 2nd bolt climb easier rock to a nice belay ledge. Two bolt anchor. 90' 5.10c/d, height dependent.Pitch 1.b: About 25' to the right of the regular start is an offwidth corner/left facing crack. Climb the offwidth to a hand crack. From here the crack constricts and is tips liebacking. Lieback up under the block and surmount the block. Traverse left on a left slanting finger crack and up onto the pillar. 100' 5.11bPitch 2: Climb up the left facing corner/crack system past two bolts. The bolts are not necessary if you have small cams and stoppers. The crack goes from tips, to hands to a wide flare past a set of anchors. Skip these and go up to the next set of anchors. There is some loose rock in this section but good cam placements can be found on solid varnish. 100' 5.10aFrom here we rapped with a single rope but the route continues up for three more pitches. The following pitches are 5.10c, 5.10d and 5.9. All can be rappelled with a single 60m rope.# Location
Starts at Power Failure.# Protection
Single Rack to 5" for the first 2 pitches. RP's and C3's are very helpful. For the remaining pitches add double 6"-8" cams.
