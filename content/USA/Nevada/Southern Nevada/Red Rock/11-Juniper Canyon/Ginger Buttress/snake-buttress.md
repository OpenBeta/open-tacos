# Description
If you continue uphill to the left (south) from the base of Ginger Cracks, you will reach a vague buttress going straight up the middle of the east face of the east peak of Rainbow Mountain.  Climb the buttress and the gully above.  To say more might spoil the adventure...If you are interested in more of the flavor, there is some good history inRed Rock Odyssey# Location
