# Description
Killjoy is an attractive, long pitch of crack climbing located way up the Tattle Tale Gully. Begin on the obvious, varnished slab by climbing splitter fingers and hands to a small roof. Move right around this roof to a stance, then launch up the wide hands to fists to rattly fists corner crack. Upon reaching the enormous wedged flake, step left into a seamed out corner with occasional pods that accept pro and fingers. Rappel with a 70m rope (watch your ends!).# Location
Located up the Tattle Tale Gully, this route is exactly 600 feet from the start of Olive Oil. Once you scramble through the notch to enter the gully, tunnel up underneath Heinous Penis (the obvious, beautiful leaning wide crack) and continue scrambling along the righthand wall for another 450 feet. The routes are on the right.And yes, I did say "tunnel up underneath Heinous Penis".# Protection
1x tiny to #0.4 Camalot.2x #0.5-#4 Camalot.1x #5 Camalot (optional).Medium wires.70m rope.
