# Description
I spied this route a few times when climbing on angel food wall, and finally I just had to go climb it. Quality rock. Traverse above bushes and start in a nice corner. Varied climbing through wider sections above. Continue up into an alcove and build a belay for second.# Location
This route is located directly across (north) of angel food wall. Almost directly across from tunnel vision. The route itself is south facing.To descend the route the first ascent party wedged a knotted piece of webbing like a stopper, and rapped off of that.# Protection
Single rack to 3" optional 4". No Bolts or fixed gear. There is a knotted piece of webbing wedged in a crack by the alcove that the first ascent team used for rappel.
