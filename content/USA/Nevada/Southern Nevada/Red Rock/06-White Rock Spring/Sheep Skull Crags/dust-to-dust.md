# Description
Work your way up the sandy chimney to access the tight dihedral on nice varnished rock. Climb the dihedral to a large ledge. Here, move left and climb a great finger to hand crack in a right facing corner for 25 feet (watch the rope drag). Pass a dead tree with lots of webbing and belay. 100 feet.After this, low fifth class face climbing and progressively easier (but interesting) scrambling lead to the top. Walk off right.# Location
This route climbs the crack on the other (left) side of the big tan buttress from Intestinal Flu.# Protection
Gear to 4", extra finger sized cams might be nice.
