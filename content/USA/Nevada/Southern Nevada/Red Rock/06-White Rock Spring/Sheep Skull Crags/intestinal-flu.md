# Description
On the left side of the Sheep Skull Crags formation there is an orange pillar of sandstone. On the right side of this pillar is a wide chimney with a large chockstone wedged into place. Intestinal Flu climbs this chimney. There is an optional belay position (slings) at about fifty feet up, on top of the chockstone. Once past that position swing out left past a roof and up the offwidth crack. Belay at the top of the crack at some fixed slings.Breaking the climb up into two pitches might be a good idea in order to avoid heinous rope drag.Descend by rappelling from the slings with one 60 meter rope, or continue up with third class scrambling to the top of the cliff and walk off right.# Location
# Protection
Lots of wide gear is needed. Consider bringing two #4s and one #5 in Camalot C4 or equivalent. A green Big Bro might help, too.
