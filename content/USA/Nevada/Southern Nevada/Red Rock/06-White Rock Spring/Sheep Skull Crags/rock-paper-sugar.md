# Description
Would be surprised to find out no one has ever climbed this before us. There were, however, no signs of traffic and a bit of crumbling rock in places.Easy stemming up sugary rock to nicely varnished wideness. After reaching a comfy ledge you have 2 options; continue up the wide chasm on the right or go left up less than stellar rock.Worth doing as the sugary parts are made up for by the nicely varnished ow.# Location
Just to the left of dust to dust.There is a dead tree that is really of no use. Be creative and you can find a decent anchor. Key word here is decent.  There was also more weathered tat around a chockstone. This was clearly put up by someone of freakishly tall stature and is less than inspiring as a rap option. We opted for the walk off descent which made for a full value bush-whacking ow climbing day.# Protection
SR. I took doubles of 5 and 6 and was only hindered by them. Big bros could be nice, but I survived without them so that's your call.
