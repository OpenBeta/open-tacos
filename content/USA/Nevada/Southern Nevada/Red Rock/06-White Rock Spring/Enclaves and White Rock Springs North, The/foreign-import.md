# Description
Foreign Import takes a spectacular, very steep line up an intimidating prow of rock. Easier, sporty vertical climbing leads to a steep crux with great position and pumpy moves.The only detractor is a fair bit of loose rock but this will clean up with traffic to leave behind a classic pitch.# Location
Located on a north-facing buttress in the wash just north of the Angel Food Wall; A bit of mellow cross country bushwhacking from the White Rock Spring TH.# Protection
11 bolts to an anchor. 80m rope mandatory for lowering.
