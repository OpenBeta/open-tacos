# Description
Another classic Enclaves testpiece.Begin by clipping a bolt and doing a difficult move to get established on the face. More difficult moves (crux) lead left past two more bolts to the arete and a decent shake. Shift gears to trad-mode and climb with commitment past two horizontals and a tough finish.Probably more like PG13 if you get the gear in just right, but it is tricky and pumpy!# Location
On a northwest facing panel of nice black varnish tucked up in a gully to the east and above Saracen. From Saracen there's a bit of bushwhacking across and up the hillside to the left to get to it.# Protection
A few draws and gear from Grey Ghost to 1.5" size. Some stoppers/RP's might be nice. I used an offset Alien and the rare Butterscotch Alien. Yummy!
