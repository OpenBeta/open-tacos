# Description
Nice crack.  Bulgy thin hands start to easier finish.  The lefthand finish is better than the bushy chimney.  A little grungy rock at the start, but quite fun overall.# Location
First, climb Purblind Pillar.  Then, instead of following the standard descent gully (northern-most), veer into the gully to skier's right.  Downclimb a cl4 chimney/slab past rap slings around a block.  Look across the gully.  The left crack on the small buttress in front of you is the route.  Climb it.  Feel free to continue cleaning the start, as well.If you bothered to bring two ropes, in theory you could just rap the route.  We rapped off the backside about 50', then scrambled down and left to a somewhat exposed rap off a scrub oak.  A 60m rope just makes it.  Slings and rings on both trees.# Protection
Standard rack to #4.  Tree anchor at top.
