# Description
This route is a blast and deserves more attention! Though the climbing is relatively easy it feels like a great adventure.Pitch 1 - Start in the corner system 30' left of Tunnel Vision. Climb past the bulge and wander up and to the right on big holds. Pass old bail webbing and climb into the huge chimney. There is more old rappel webbing here; ignore that and build a gear anchor. (200')Pitch 2 - The deep dark chimney. You will know you are on route and heading in the right direction once you hit the "Sandy Hole /Ledge". Head straight up from here; once level with the glowing light, make an easy traverse over and out passing a rusty bolt with a homemade hanger. Build a gear anchor near the exit of the chimney. Be mindful of rope drag. (120')Pitch 3 - From here I climbed up and right clipping a bolt, eventually linking up with the "Tunnel Pitch" of Tunnel Vision. (90')Pitch 4 & 5 - Follow Tunnel Vision to the top.On pitch 3 the original line climbs up and left however I suggest linking with Tunnel Vision to continue the caving adventure.# Location
