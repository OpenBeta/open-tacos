# Description
Continue on a right angling crack system, instead of walking up on the bushy ledge to the second pitch dihedral of The Ledger. This crack will go thru/near a couple bushes and will put you about 20 feet above the standard second pitch start (see pic). You will have several flakes at your face as you traverse 12' right (crux) to gain the left facing dihedral. Continue up dihedral, linking the pitches to the web/cord anchor and start of the traditional third pitch (55m total)# Location
