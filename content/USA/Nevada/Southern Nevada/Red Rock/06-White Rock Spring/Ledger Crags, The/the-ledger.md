# Description
This route travels up the dihedral on the far left side of the cliff. The prominent corner of the second pitch is not quite visible from the road nor from the hike in. The start is about fifty feet to the left of the start of the route "Holed Up", which features a black hole in the center of the brown rock on the second pitch.The short first pitch of The Ledger follows a dirty corner system through some vegetation including some yuccas to a large bushy ledge.Pitch two follows the obvious dihedral to the next large ledge.Pitch three climbs the left leaning crack through a well-protected crux to the top of the cliff. The exposure here is exciting.Descend by walking off left into the gully that separates the cliff from Sheep Skull Crags. Route finding here is not obvious and the gully is quite overgrown. An alternative descent involves hiking to the right and down climbing a short way to a rappel tree. A single rappel with two 60 meter ropes gets you to the ground.# Location
