# Description
Although it's called Grumblefish, it might also be called Crumblefish (groan!). Left of the Smears for Fears slab is a large, crumbly looking right-facing corner. Don't worry, it's about as crumbly as it looks. And don't worry, you'll be fine. Start slightly right on two bolts past some wafers on the left. Continue up the corner with good gear part some funky holds and vegetation. Eventually step right to hit the Smears for Fears anchors. A fun route to do because of the wonky holds on it. Also a good way to put a top rope on Smears for Fears if you want to check it out.# Location
Right and around the corner from Frigid Air Buttress and across the canyon from Sunnyside crags is the Smears for Fears area, a steep black slab bounded by a large, right-facing white corner on the left side. This right-facing corner is the climb.# Protection
