# Description
Climb a right-slanting crack for about 30' to a rounded arete.  Climb straight up the rounded arete and the face to the right on excellent varnish.  Follow the features placing pro where you can until pulling onto a low-angle slab at about 100ft.  A 30ft. runout on easy slab brings you to a two-bolt anchor.  The climbing on Romeo is excellent and technical, but the well-spaced gear makes for a somewhat serious and proud lead.  If you're a solid 5.10 RR leader go for it!# Location
