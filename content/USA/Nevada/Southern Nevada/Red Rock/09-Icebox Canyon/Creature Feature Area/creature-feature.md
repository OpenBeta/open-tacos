# Description
P1: Start on a solid gray face, the first 10' of the start could easily be contrived by moving 6 feet right. We however went strait up the face right where the picture shows, for some better steeper moves. Finish through the black corner (wide) and pull around some scrubs. Build belay on big ledge. 5.8 60'.P2: Head strait up over a big solid flake toward two small bulges under a huge chimney. Work through the chimney (easier ground) on the right side crack with good face holds. Gain another big ledge and build belay. 5.8 100'.P3: Start in another wide section follow up a ways.Small traverse gains the varnish bullet stone near some awesome plated rock. Keep heading up about center, jugs keep popping up and pro options if you want them. You hit another big legde on plated varnish and you could build a optional belay or do another 20' on some cool flakes and topout. 5.6 150'.# Location
