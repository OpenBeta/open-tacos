# Description
Two pitches of fun climbing capped by a delightfully long left facing corner.P1:  Fifth class up a slightly mossy start directly under the route.  Sporty moves down low get you started.P2:  The start is a bit spooky on perfect varnish.  Another sporty section that protects and climbs nicely.P3:  Long pitch.  Perfect rock.  Cruise (or struggle) past some wide sections.  Savor the slightly intimidating stretch of perfect fingers.  Then jam your way through various sizes to the anchor.# Location
