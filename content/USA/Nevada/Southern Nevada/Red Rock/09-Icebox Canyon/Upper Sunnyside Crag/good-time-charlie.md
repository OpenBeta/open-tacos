# Description
This is the left-hand crack system on the darkly varnished wall immediately to the left of the giant square roof.  Start in a small dihedral just to the right of the left-facing corner leading to the low roof.  Climb straight up until the crack peters out and the climbing becomes improbable.  Go up and right joiningDrat Crackfinal few feet to the belay.  A second pitch (somewhat easier) leads up and right to a bush at the corner of the big square roof.  Either rappel into the corner below, or (probably better) rappel the route.# Location
