# Description
This is an interesting route with some good climbing.  The name relates to the long, fully enclosed tunnel on the fifth pitch.  Two ropes are needed for the rappel.About a hundred yards to the left of the Frigid Air Buttress, a rounded whitish apron leans against the lower wall.  Scramble up ledges on its left side for a few hundred feet to a rope-up point where the rock steepens.Pitch 1: On the right, climb a convoluted offwidth crack formed by the left edge of a huge flake (5.9).  The easier chimney above is unprotected.  The flake rounds off to a good belay ledge (which is also the ledge beneath the 5.9 handcrack halfway up the Frigid Air Buttress route).Pitch 2: Avoid the FAB crack, and instead climb the left-leaning jam crack in the clean varnished wall on the left. (5.8)Pitch 3: A short pitch up and left to a big ledge.Pitch 4: Move to the back right corner of the ledge and climb a varnished corner, then go left and belay among broken rocks in the main gully system.Pitch 5: Climb to the back of the gully then go up a dark, tight, fully enclosed vertical chimney tunnel.Pitch 6: Easy climbing leads to the top.Descent: Scramble left to the standard rappel route (2 ropes) down Burlesque.# Location
