# Description
Head up and slightly left on ledgy terrain with some 5.6 moves thrown in to a large ledge, then cut right up a left facing corner to a smaller ledge with some foliage. You know you're there when you're 180 feet up. Pitch 2 heads up the funky fist crack at 5.7/8, liebacking and jamming to a ledge. After your second joins you move left and drop down to a larger ledge with a tree. Pitch 3 shares 5.8+ crack with Burlesque, ends at good rap anchor beneath a short, crescent shaped chimney section. Pitch 4 is the crux: instead of traversing the flake left to finish Burlesque, head straight up toward obvious chimneys and a sawblade-looking flake protruding from it. Protection is intermittent and not always in quality rock, but the climbing is super varied and good. A little of everything on this one, capped by a smooth finishing chimney in solid chocolate varnish with a roof crack to a ledge. A scramble up and left puts you in position to rappel Burlesque# Location
Starts 80ft right of the waterfall pool on a good sized ledge. This climb could easily be called Burlesque Direct if we didn't laugh so hard at the Dear Diary joke while climbing it.# Protection
We carried double cams up to #3 BD-extra 2s and 3s would make the pitch safer and bring lots of long slings-drag was an issue even with doubles. A #4 camalot makes the P4 anchor bomber. Loose rock and challenging protection.
