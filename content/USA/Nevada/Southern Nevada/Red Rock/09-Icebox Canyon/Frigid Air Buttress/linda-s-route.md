# Description
Follow the line to the right of Frigid Air Buttress eventually sharing the last pitch of that route.P1: 5.8, 70m beginning at a short face to the crack mentioned in the description above to a bushy ledge.  There is definitely some vegetation and moss at the top of the pitch.  Belay at the oak trees at the base of the chimney.P2: 5.8, 65m.  From the oak tree, climb up the squeezy chimney and then into a narrower crack system.  The ramp to the chimney and the bottom of the chimney protect poorly.P3: 5.7, 40m.  Follow a vegetated corner system into a roof and step right onto the featured face.  Easy face climbing up to a very large treed ledge.P4: 5.9, 70m.  Shift the belay to the base of the large clean chimney just left of the impossible right sweeping crescent crack.  Stem and body chimney about half a pitch to some face climbing and into a corner system to the base of the final pitch of Frigidaire Buttress.  Gear larger than a #4 likely won't help protect the chimney.  Belay at a treed ledge at the base of the final pitch.P5: 5.9+.  From the treed ledge, climb up a 5.7 face to the base of the hand then finger crack.  The crux is perhaps 30' up the crack where it briefly narrows to a short shallow off fingers section.  Rattle or lieback this finger crack past the crux.  After that short section, the difficulty eases up considerably.  After the crack ends, climb a short unprotected face (5.7) above a gully to belay at boulders and trees below the final scramble pitch# Location
