# Description
This is a good mixed route that starts just right of Frigid Air Buttress.  Climb up the face, eventually passing 4 bolts.  Work up the varnished slab and pass the white roof on the left edge. Move back right passing two more bolts to a bolted anchor.# Location
Blue Bunny starts 50' to the right of the first pitch of Frigid Air Buttress.2 ropes are required to rap off.It looked possible to pendulum hard to the east and hit the anchors at the top of the flake on the 1st pitch of Frigid Air Buttress, making it possible to get off with one rope.  I did not try this and it will take a fairly aggressive pendulum.# Protection
Single rack to 1".6 bolts.Fixed anchor at the top.
