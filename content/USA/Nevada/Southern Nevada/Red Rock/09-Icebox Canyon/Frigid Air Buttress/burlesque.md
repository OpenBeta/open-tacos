Burlesque is located in the drainage that separates Necromancer from Frigid Air Buttress in Icebox Canyon. It is also the descent route for Frigid Air. The route is about 100 yards further upstream, to the left of Frigid Air. It is also about 50 yards downstream from the waterfall at the back of the drainage. The landmark feature is the giant flake that looks like a bomb bay roof on the third pitch.# Protection
Standard rack plus some wide gear. We used an old style #5 Camalot. Consider a #3 Big Bro.
