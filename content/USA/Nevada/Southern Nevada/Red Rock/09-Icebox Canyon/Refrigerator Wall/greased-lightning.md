# Description
The refrigerator wall is true to its name and is a cool respite even on hot days in Vegas.  The climbing on this route is great but this route should only be attempted by a confident 5.10 leader.Begin on a a small ramp on the left side of the wall.  This route requires some route finding and follows a series of discontinous cracks.  Take pro when you get it as it is not always present.  Continue up cracks and face trending rightward.  The crux is on the lower part of the route but the pro will keep you interested all the way to the top.  End on a nice grassy ledge with bolted anchors.Rap with two ropes.# Location
# Protection
a regular rack with the addition of small nuts and cams.bolted anchor at top.
