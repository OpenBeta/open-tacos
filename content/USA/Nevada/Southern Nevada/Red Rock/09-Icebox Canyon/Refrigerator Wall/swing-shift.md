# Description
Start up the system to the right of Greased Lightning ending at the same ledge for 1 or 2 pitches. Continue up the system above for 4-5 more pitches. Be careful of loose rock on the next pitch up left around the corner. The next pitch goes out on the face and back left to the corner at .10b. The following pitch climbs the desperately smooth tips corner at cruxy .10c. Then climb the chimney, it is not as hard as it looks. Add another pitch and find your way back down rappels mostly on route.# Location
# Protection
Gear, offwidth isn't needed for the chimney, but couldn't hurt.
