# Description
A great pitch with some funkadelic moves through many different sizes.  Although the rock is pretty clean-cut, this crack isn't exactly a straight forward corner and you may find yourself doing strange things both painful yet satisfying.  I thought the highlight of this route was the OW flare but this route is continuously throwing in something different when you least expect.# Location
Right of the Refrigerator Wall.Approach: Continue hiking upstream after the trail drops down into the wash.  Look for a trail leading uphill on left towards the arch.  Bushwhack your way up to a bushy ledge, then gain the route by scrambling 4th class for another 40-50 feet to a ledge with a small stump.  Rope/rack up here, then continue climbing another 25 feet until you reach the crack via traversing left on a small foot ledgeDescent: 2 60m ropes will get you down off a nice bolted anchor# Protection
Single Rack with doubles of #4, #5, and #6 Camalot or equivalent
