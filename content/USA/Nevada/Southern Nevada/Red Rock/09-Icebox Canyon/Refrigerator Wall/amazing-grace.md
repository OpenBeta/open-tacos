# Description
Amazing Grace is an enjoyable two-part climb: Part one is a spicy slab with plenty of positive holds and part two is a flare with pods for deep but solid gear placements.Start behind an large pine tree in a alcove. Three well-spaced bolts on ledgy terrain lead to an obvious left-facing, left-leaning corner/flare. Follow this awkwardly up and left, eventually stepping up onto the face, to a bolted anchor.Gear to 3", long slings suggested due to the wandering nature of the route.# Location
