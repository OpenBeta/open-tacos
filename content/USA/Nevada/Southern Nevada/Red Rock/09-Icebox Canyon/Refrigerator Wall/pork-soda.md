# Description
Fun, rampy corner left of Grape Nuts to a surprisingly burly feeling crux. Tops out on shared ledge with Grape Nuts/Amazing Grace, easy to use that anchor to belay/descend.# Location
Starts in a brushy alcove down and left of Grape Nuts, at a slick thin hands crack.# Protection
SR to 6"-if you left the wide gear at home, this is easy to TR after either of the other 2 routes on the right. Save a #1 Camalot for the traverse to the anchor-makes it much safer for your second and eases rope management. Rap with 1 60.
