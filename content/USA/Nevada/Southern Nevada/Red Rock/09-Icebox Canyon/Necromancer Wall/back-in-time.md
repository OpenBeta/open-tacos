# Description
To the right of Atras is an exceptional face climb on some of the best sandstone at RR. Cassandra's comment on Atras led me to be curious about this one. The movement is fun and the climbing thought provoking.# Location
Just to the right of Atras at one of the many descent steps from the top of Necromancer Wall. The climb will be obvious.# Protection
Although this route is equipped with seven (?) well positioned bolts, it climbs more like a trad line. It does seem possible to supplement with a few pieces of gear. Two bolts with rappel rings make up the anchor at the top.
