# Description
This is route "A" in the picture.The Hop Route is found on the left side of the wall and starts one of two ways: 1) In the prominent right-facing corner system (5.7+) or 2) in a nice looking hand crack (5.7) fifteen feet to the right of the corner that sort of arches up and left to join the corner. Either way, climb up to the top of the corner where there are some chockstones. You can rap from here off slings (most do), or continue up another couple pitches via cracks. If you do this, descent is supposed to be walk off towards the road.# Location
