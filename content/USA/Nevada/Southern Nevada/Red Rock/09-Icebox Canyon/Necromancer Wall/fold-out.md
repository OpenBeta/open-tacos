# Description
This is route "D" in the photo.This is the prominent crack system running straight up the right side of the Necromancer wall. Can't miss it. Most of this is sort of 5.5 jugs, but there's a fifteen foot section of 5.8 finger crack about 90 feet up that takes you to the anchor. Rap with two ropes.  Note: I'd guess this would be a pretty good lead for someone looking to break into the 5.8 range.# Location
# Protection
Standard rack. Small to #3 Camalot or so. Bring a few doubles in the bigger cams if you want to sew it up.
