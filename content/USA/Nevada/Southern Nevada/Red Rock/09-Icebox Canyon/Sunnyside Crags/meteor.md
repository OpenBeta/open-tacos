# Description
This climb start in the cave just to the right of Cold September Corner.  Start on some jugs on a flake and work your way up into the downward flaring slot.  From here some jams and wriggling will get you to the stem rest.  A few more grunty moves see you to the lip where the climbing eases.  Climb a few more feet to the rap anchor.  From here there is a seldom done second pitch, which goes at 5.9.# Location
Just to the right of Cold September Corner, on the patio like ledge.# Protection
Single rack to #3 camalot, double to #1
