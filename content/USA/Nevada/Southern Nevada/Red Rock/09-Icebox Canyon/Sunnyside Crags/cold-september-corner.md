# Description
Start in the corner to the right of the low roof which forms a cave in the middle of Sunnyside Crags.  Climb the corner crack up through a couple roofs to a anchor under another big roof. This route is very intimidating for the grade, but the moves are there and are very enjoyable.# Location
