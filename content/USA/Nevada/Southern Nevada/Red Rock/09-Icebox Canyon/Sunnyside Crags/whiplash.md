# Description
Way better climbing than it first appears. No joke.  Climb the vertical crack by the tree up to the roof.  Climb left out the roof, past a bolt on steep terrain to gain the short left leaning crack system.# Location
100 feet right of Cold September Corner, below the ledge for Meteor.  The start of the route is a crack behind a tree.# Protection
Double rack to #2 camalot. Wires.
