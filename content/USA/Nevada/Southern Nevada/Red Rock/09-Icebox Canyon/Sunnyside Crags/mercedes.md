# Description
This is a mixed route unless you want to make a long runout in the beginning and at the finish of the climb; don't go up with just quickdraws! Start left on the face well below the first of the four protection bolts with easy moves. Then power up left past the roof into a shallow corner. Pull more exposed moves onto slab and climb straight up to a fixed anchor. Fun route with exciting climbing.# Location
# Protection
A few cams from 00' tcu to 1", a few small nut, a few quickdraws, and 2 over the shoulder slings.
