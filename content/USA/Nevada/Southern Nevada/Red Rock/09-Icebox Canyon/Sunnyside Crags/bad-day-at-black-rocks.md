# Description
This is a fun route. It's a bit of a one-move wonder - the crux is a short boulder problem - but the moves are fun.Start below two bolts low on the face left of an arete. Climb up the black face on small holds past the bolts (crux), then continue with easier moves up the face to a chain anchor (the same anchor as for Tie Me Tightly).According to the Brock-McMillen guide, one can climb a second 5.8 pitch to the top of the cliff.# Location
Bad Day at Black Rocks is on the far right edge of the wall right of the Mercedes corner (right of Mister Masters). This route is 60 feet left of Van Allen Belt and 15 feet left of a small cave.# Protection
2 bolts protect the crux; small nuts and aliens protect the upper face.
