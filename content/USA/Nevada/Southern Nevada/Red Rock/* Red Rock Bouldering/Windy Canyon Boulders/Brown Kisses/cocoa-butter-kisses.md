# Description
A fun little lowball to try if you're looking for something a bit harder than the problems nearby. Start deep in the cave matched on a set of good crimps. Use smaller holds in either the roof or the wall to traverse to a decently sized jug rail. Link into the finish of Brown Kisses (V0). Body positioning and foot technique is key, but if you're strong enough you can probably just power through it. It's lowball nature and nearby rocks on both the start and exit make it extremely easy to dab. Purists beware.I found these chalked up holds near Brown Kisses the other day and after quite a bit of projecting it seemed to make an interesting route. Not sure who did the FA but I figured it was worth sharing.# Location
To the right of Brown Kisses about as deep into the cave as you can get.# Protection
