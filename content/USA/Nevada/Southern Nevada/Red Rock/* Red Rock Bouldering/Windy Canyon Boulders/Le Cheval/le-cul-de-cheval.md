# Description
Fun little sloper power problem on nice water polished rock. Start with two crimps down and right and work up and left through an amazing sloper feature to an easy top out.# Location
From Le Cheval walk to the opposite side of the boulder. This problem is slightly tucked away in the wash.# Protection
