# Description
Great moves on bulletproof varnished sandstone. Climb the northern arete with obvious holds, halfway up is a committing move.# Location
From the Warm Up Boulder, go due south into the wash, and find the large boulder on the west side of the wash with the darkly varnished eastern slope.# Protection
Slightly highball, reccomend a boulder pad and a spotter or two.
