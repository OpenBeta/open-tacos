# Description
Classic easy problem, certainly a must do if you're over by the Fish Head boulders.Bulletproof rock, great movement, decent landing.I can see this as possibly being harder for shorter climbers, but its easy with good balance# Location
Start in opposing sidepulls about chest height and climb up the right-facing flake.Option B is located downhill of the Fish Head, just past the big crack boulder.You can climb down the backside on a low angle slab# Protection
A few pads is just fine
