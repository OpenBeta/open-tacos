# Description
Stand start on the rail, move to a LH crimp right at the arete. Then a big move out to the lip. Top out above that.Beautiful climb in a really nice location.This is in the corridor of the Fish Head Boulder which stays shady and cool.# Location
Located on the Fish Head boulder which is easily spotted from the parking area. Just look out onto the hill under the prominent Windy Peak and spot the massive fish-head-coming-out-of-the-water-to-eat-you looking thing.Take the main trail until you pass thru the brown rocks and then try to find the faint social trail/bushwhack to this big-ass boulder. Approach 20ish mins.The problem starts just right of Bait and Tackle in the obvious rail.# Protection
Couple pads, a spotter, decent landing.
