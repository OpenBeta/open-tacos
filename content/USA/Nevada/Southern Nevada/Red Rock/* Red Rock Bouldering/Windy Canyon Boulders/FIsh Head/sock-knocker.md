# Description
Hardest move of the problem is figuring how to get that flat edge after matching on the sloper.Shorter climbers have to make a slightly reachy move around the bulge. Even though its fairly low angle, there's still 15-20ft until you're at the top of the boulder- Don't forget to bring your chalkbag!Besides that, this is an incredible problem! Joe's Valley style rock.# Location
Located right in between the two Fish Head boulders.Start almost in the cave matched on a good ledge head-height. A lower start adds a grade or two.To get down, climb over to the right side of the boulder where the angle lessens and scoot your way down the slab. Alternatively, there's a bunch of two bolt anchors that you could rappel from.# Protection
Just a few pads are good. You don't want to fall from high up on the slab though...
