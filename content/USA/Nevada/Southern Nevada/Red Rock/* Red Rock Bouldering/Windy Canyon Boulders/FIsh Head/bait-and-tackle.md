# Description
An awesome problem for the grade with some really fun but positive moment. Stand-start on the big ledge and move up into the triangle.Top-out has huge feet but just enough challenge with the hands to keep you focused all the way to the top.# Location
Located on the Fish Head boulders which is easily spotted from the parking area. Just look out onto the hill and spot the massive fish-head-coming-out-of-the-water-to-eat-you looking thing. Take the main trail until you pass the brown rocks and then try to find the faint social trail/bushwhack to this big-ass boulder.Start is obvious.# Protection
Nice landing. 2 pads would be adequate for most.
