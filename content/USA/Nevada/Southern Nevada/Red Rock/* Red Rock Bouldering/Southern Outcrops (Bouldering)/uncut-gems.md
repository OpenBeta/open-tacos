# Description
Begin beneath the overhang on the arete with your left hand on a sloped crimp and your right hand far to the right on a decent side-pull. Use a good ledge at the base of the roof for your foot. Move up and right into the flared crack, and then ascend the face just right of the arete. There is a subtle incut on the top of the boulder, a few feet back from the lip that makes the mantle reasonable. Alternatively, for a deduction in style points, you can traverse the lip far to the right and top out on easier holds.# Location
