# Description
Begin in a hole with your left hand on a rounded edge, your right hand on a swooping rail, and a heel hook. Move up and right on Joeâ€™s Valley-esque features to reach the lip. Top out by moving right onto a large ramp and following it up to the top. Beginning with both hands on the sloper rail is an open project and may be impossible.# Location
