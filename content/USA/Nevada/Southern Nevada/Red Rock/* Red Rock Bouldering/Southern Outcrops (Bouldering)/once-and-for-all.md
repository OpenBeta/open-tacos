# Description
Begin matched on two crimps down in a hole. Ascend the angled crimp rails up the face until you can reach the lip. Get a high foot and mantle over. Fantastic crimps on bomber rock.# Location
Location: This boulder is located about half a mile uphill from the Totem boulder. The hike is steep and strenuous. Once you reach the large, varnished boulders in the saddle between Hollow Rock Peak and South Peak, head briefly uphill toward Hollow Rock Peak. This problem is located on the uphill side of a medium sized, varnished boulder.Total time from car: 80 minutes# Protection
