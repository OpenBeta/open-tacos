# Description
The direct variation to total devastation. Shares the same crux move. Instead of bailing out left climb up to a hollow flake and up to a difficult top out where the climb gets it's name. Very balance intensive climb past the crux of total devastation. Basically once you get to the Crux move of total devastation climb up and right to a flake and up to the top!# Location
Same start as total devastation next to the Arete.# Protection
3 pads, but you don't want to fall off past the crux pocket move or the mantle!
