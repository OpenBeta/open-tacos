# Description
Tall and good. Lots of sloping edges lead to larger sloping edges for 30 feet of great stone. This has a low crux, so this climb actually serves well as a down climb from the boulder.Can be started on the left and traverse up and right to the ledges, or start on the right, and traverse up left into the ledge system.# Location
On the Cube, around the corner to the left of Fear of a Black Hat. Look for a series of ledges leading to the summit.# Protection
2-3 pads for the bottom, don't fall from mid way up.
