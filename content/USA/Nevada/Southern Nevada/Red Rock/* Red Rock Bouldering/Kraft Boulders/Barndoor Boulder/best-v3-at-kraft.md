# Description
Start on the sloping right leaning rail, and head toward the large juggy holds up and right.  Mantle on the jugs, gain the funky slot hold straight up, then traverse to the right to top out.  This problem is quite good, but is kind of high, and has a large boulder behind you to watch out for if you come off.# Location
This problem is located on the southeast side of the boulder, in a little alcove like feature.  It is easy to identify as it is the right leaning rail, and is the only problem on the boulder with well chalked holds.# Protection
A couple of pads and spotters.
