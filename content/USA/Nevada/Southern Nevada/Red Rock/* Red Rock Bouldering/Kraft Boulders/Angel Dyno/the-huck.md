# Description
Start as for the Angel Dyno but move more or less straight up to a small but positive right hand crimper. Find the foot beta and make a long reach to the lip.  Mantle it out and move along.  A great sequence.If anyone knows the name and grade post it up.# Location
# Protection
Crashpad and a spotter feels good.
