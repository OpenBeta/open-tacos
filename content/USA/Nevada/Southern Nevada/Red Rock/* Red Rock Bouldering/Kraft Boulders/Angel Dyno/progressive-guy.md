# Description
This line climbs the clean overhanging arete to the right of Angel Dyno. Sit start on the low rail and work up and left on a small left hand crimp and atrocious right hand sloper. Stay tight for the powerful crux move to the left hand rail and finish on glory holds.Tall people can span from a low right rail all the way to the high left hand, but thats just not that sick.# Location
