# Description
A brilliant boulder problem on the back side of the Plumbers Crack Boulder. Stays in the shade all day, and climbs some of the highest quality stone at Kraft.Start with opposing side-pulls and a wide stem, make a hard move to a left hand pinch and then the crux move to a right facing ear. Finish up and right to an obvious jug at the top of the neighboring V5, top out via easy, albeit very highball terrain.Although Slice N Dice is better known, it is a variation of 'Plunger' V9 which shares the same crux but takes it's own line straight to the top.# Location
Back side (uphill side) of giant Plumbers Crack Boulder.# Protection
Couple Pads, spotters
