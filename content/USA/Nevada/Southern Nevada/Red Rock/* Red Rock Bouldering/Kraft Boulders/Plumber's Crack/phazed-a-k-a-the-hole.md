# Description
A brutal little boulder problem on the far right of the back-side of the Plumbers Crack Boulder.Sit start with an incut left hand side-pull and a low, flat, right hand crimp. Hard first move to a gnarly potato chip edge out right, then work your way through small edges to the lip.Very good rock quality. Would be 4 stars without a giant hole under you and if it wasn't squeezed in next to the Mole.# Location
Just to the right of 'The Mole' V5/6 on the Plumbers Crack Boulder.# Protection
3-4 Pads. You'll need to fill in a body sized hole that's just beneath the climb with pads.
