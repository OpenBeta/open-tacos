# Description
Leavittate the left leaning wide flake/crack on the boulder behind Plumber's Crack.  It can be laybacked at about 5.6, but that defeats the purpose of the exercise.# Location
On the boulder to the north of Plumber's Crack.  LWC faces north.# Protection
Crashpad helpful if the heel-toe jams get too painful and you have to bail onto your head.
