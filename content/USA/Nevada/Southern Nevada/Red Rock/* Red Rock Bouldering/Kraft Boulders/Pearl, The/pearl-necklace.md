# Description
This is a sit start to the classic problem "The Pearl V4" You start matched on the obvious crimp rail and then make a move left to a 1 or 2 finger pocket depending on the size of your fingers. From here continue up The Pearl. The crux is figuring out how to get the correct feet to make the first move.# Location
