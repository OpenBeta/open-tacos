# Description
Start standing on the ramp and use holds that seem to be all facing the wrong way to topout.  Given V4 in the Jenson guidebook, but if The Pearl is the standard V4, this is less.# Location
Just to the right of The Pearl.The Pearl is the center line of chalked up holds on a slightly overhanging face. The Clam Bumper (supposedly also V4 but nowhere near as cruxy as The Pearl) is another route just to the right that starts on the ramp and moves up through the other chalked holds on the right side of this photo.# Protection
