# Description
The Pearl is a classic line on The Pearl boulder.  The face is slightly overhanging, and the start holds barely there.  The original start is standing up with left hand in a pocket and right hand lower on a ledgy crimp (which has now broken and can still be used as a decent sidepull).  It's really only a move or two until you are home free.  Descent is on the opposite side of the boulder.# Location
See photo to check out the line, and the boulder description for directions.# Protection
Pads and a spotter are nice, but the crux move(s) are low.
