# Description
Start on the far right side of the slopey shelf with two hands and a heel on. Traverse right to left. Hit the crimp and throw for a jug at the transition. Climb to and up the arete, using slopey (some hidden jugs) holds and invisible feet (or gymnastic heel-hooks).# Location

Crashpad and a spotter since there's a back-slapper boulder under the top-out transition.
