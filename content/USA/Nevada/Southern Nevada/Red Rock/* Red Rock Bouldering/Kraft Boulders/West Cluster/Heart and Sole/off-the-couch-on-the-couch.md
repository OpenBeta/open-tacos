# Description
A fun traverse where you make your way down around and back to the point where you started, but now on top of the boulder. Stand on the northeast corner of the bolder and make your way left via the flake and series of underclings. As you come to the end of the flake, follow it upwards as it becomes a spine to the top out.# Location
# Protection
Several pads for uneven and cobbled ground.
