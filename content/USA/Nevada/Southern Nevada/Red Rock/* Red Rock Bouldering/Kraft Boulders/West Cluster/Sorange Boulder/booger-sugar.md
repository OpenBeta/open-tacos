# Description
Start low on sandy, gaston sloper with a right heel hook. Move up into better sandy holds and eventually right onto the face. Not great, but worth doing if you have done everything else in the area.*Not claiming first ascent or route name. Hit me up with proper details.# Location
Immediately to the left of "Welcome to Detroit"# Protection
