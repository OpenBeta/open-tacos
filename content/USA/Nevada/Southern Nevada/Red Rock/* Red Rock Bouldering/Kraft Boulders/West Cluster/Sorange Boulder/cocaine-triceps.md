# Description
Commonly mistaken asCocaine Biceps, this route climbs about 10 feet left of the actual route featured in the guidebook and is extremely similar in description. However, this route is not present in a scoopy dihedral and is on more of a flat face/crack.Start in an undercling/sidepull with good feet and slap up for the lip. Mantle with difficulty.The feet, and therefore first move, are easier than the first move of cocaine biceps, however the mantle is much harder (hence the name). Difficulty feels comparable.If anyone has more feedback or the true name of this route please comment, otherwise good luck!# Location
