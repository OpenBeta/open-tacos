# Description
The crimpiest line on the Beth Wald boulder climbs through small crimps just left of Potato Chips. Two obvious variations exist.The V7 version starts on the same holds (a left-hand crimp and right-hand sidepull crimp) as Potato Chips, then moves immediately left into a small, left hand crimp. Center avoids all holds on Potato Chips after the start, following a line of sharp, but increasingly positive, crimps to the lip of the boulder.A more direct, V9 variation starts from a crouch on a poor right-hand crimp and left-hand undercling (or crimp) and climbs straight into the line describe above.# Location
The line immediately left of Potato Chips.# Protection
