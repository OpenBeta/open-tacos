# Description
Start with your left hand as low as possible on a crimp / side pull a few feet left of the potato chips start. Use the lowest right hand on the "main" potato chips line. This adds one hand movement and a couple of foot movements (depending on how you do it) to potato chips. Figured I'd create a separate climb on MP since this variation is worth doing (in my opinion).# Location
