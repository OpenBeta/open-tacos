# Description
Fire is pronounced Fee-Ray, like the shoes from back in the day.Start matched on the big jug that starts the left trending rail.  Head up the rail to a pair of bad holds.  From there the holds get better as you head towards the top.# Location
Stand start on the jug on the left side of the boulder.# Protection
The landing is a little odd, and the top is kind of high so a few pads and spotters are very helpful.
