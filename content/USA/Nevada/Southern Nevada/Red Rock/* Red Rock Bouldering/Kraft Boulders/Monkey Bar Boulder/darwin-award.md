# Description
Tired of falling on the third move of Monkey Bar Direct? Are the swarms of people getting to your head and harshing your mellow? Do you find yourself asking "Is there more to my life?"Luckily the answer is YES, and it all starts with an ascent of Darwin Award.Sit start on the South/West side of the natural shelter. Traverse up and left using some decent holds and a few heel hooks. Eventually you reach a good sloper, which is about the same time you decide you'd rather be hanging upside-down. So stuff both your feet up inside the crack and just chill out man, you're stressin'. Do several traversing moves while inverted, eventually reaching an OK hand jam and transitioning back upright. Try not to cut feet and pull the finishing move which tops out the leaning slab that creates the shelter. If super psyched, continue up to the top of the Monkey Bar Boulder.Several variations of this problem exist changing the difficulty from V1 - V4 depending on how you choose to climb it.# Location
In the natural shelter on the West side of the Monkey Bar Boulder.# Protection
