# Description
Sit start on the left-most jug of the main juggy-cave-thing area. Traverse right on big happy jugs (yay!). At the corner, starting climbing up. Make a big throw from an undercling thingie to a big incut jug out on the arete. Alternately, try a scary feeling-cross off a shallow half-tips pocket. After attaining the incut jug, climb fairly directly up on big holds.# Location
Line is fairly obvious me thinks. Topout is just left of the hard classic stuff (V6-8). Don't fall on any skinny V8 climbers ;).# Protection
Crashpad. Maybe a spotter for the topout and/or the crux move.
