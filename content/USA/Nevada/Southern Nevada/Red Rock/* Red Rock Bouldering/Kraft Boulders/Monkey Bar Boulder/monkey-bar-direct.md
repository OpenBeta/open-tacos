# Description
Classic moves on steep & solid stone.Start on the huge jug at the bottom of the roof on the uphill side of the boulder. Move out to the double pockets and then fire up through positive crimps to an easy topout.Some good deadpoint skills come in handy in the 2nd half of the problem, and the crux may feel significantly more difficult for shorter people due to a lack of positive footholds.# Location
Uphill side of the Monkeybar boulder.# Protection
One crashpad.
