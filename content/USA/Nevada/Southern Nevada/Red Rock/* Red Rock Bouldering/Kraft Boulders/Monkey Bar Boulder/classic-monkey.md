# Description
Sit down start on the northwest side of the boulder. This is essentially the first problem you see as you get to the Monky Bars boulder. A few powerful moves will take you to a large sidepull jug, where you begin to trend left and up on small holds. The new bouldering guidebook gives this a V6, so that's what I'm going with.# Location
On the northwest side of the monkey bars boulder at the far east end of the Kraft boulders.# Protection
