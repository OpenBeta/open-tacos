# Description
Cyclops shares a start hold with Snake Eyes- the large pocket. Stand start using this pocket and a right hand sidepull. Fire straight up on good holds. If this is a V6 it's low in the grade. Guidebook says it's awkward but I disagree. The problem requires balance, precision and some power.# Location
