# Description
The route starts on a crimpy seam and goes up through balancy moves to a slopey rail/ledge. It is cool for three reasons: it gets almost all day shade, it does not receive much traffic, and it has very technical and delicate movement.# Location
Back (north) side of the Shady Lady Boulder.# Protection
