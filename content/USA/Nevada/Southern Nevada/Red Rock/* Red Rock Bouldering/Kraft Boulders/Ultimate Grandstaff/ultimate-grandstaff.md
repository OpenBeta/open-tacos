# Description
Ultimate Grandstaff is a quality problem located on the east side of The Ultimate Grandstaff Boulder. I would suggest trying this problem in the morning as the afternoon sun can be an issue when finding holds to use as it will be shining directly into your eyes. Stand start on two OK crimps at head height and marginal feet. If you use the left hand side pull on the arete the problem will be V3. Move up to a rail at right, then back left and right again to top out. Very good movement on very solid stone.# Location
