# Description
Same as Pretzel. But instead of going for the flat jug right before the finish of the V2, go for the long crimp rail to the left. From there, make a long move left to a sloper-jug. Finish directly above, using anything you can pull on along the ledge above.# Location
# Protection
A pad or two.
