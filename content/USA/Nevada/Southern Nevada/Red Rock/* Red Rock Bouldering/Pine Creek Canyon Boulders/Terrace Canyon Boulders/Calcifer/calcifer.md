# Description
A devious sloper rig. Begin in a sit start with a good right hand. Make a few difficult moves down low and continue up the arÃªte until you get to a decent break where you can mantle over onto the face and top out.# Location
Just past The Shining Path boulder in the canyon to the left. You will walk up to it in within a minute or two.# Protection
