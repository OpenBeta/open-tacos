# Description
A stout, near-classic V4 that loses a star due to a hollow hold before the lip. All of the other holds are fantastic. It feels like climbing an outdoor Moonboard.# Location
In the center of the Stick Gully cluster. Walk past Jabberwocky by about 100 feet and look right.# Protection
1-2 pads
