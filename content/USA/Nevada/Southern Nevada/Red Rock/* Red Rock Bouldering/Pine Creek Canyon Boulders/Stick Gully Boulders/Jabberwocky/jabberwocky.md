# Description
Powerful and dynamic movement up a beautiful 45 degree overhanging face leads to a casual angling traverse to the top out ledge.# Location
Start sitting/crouched with your left hand on a small 2/3 finger pocket and right hand on a low crimp/sidepull. Cross to a bigger crimp/pocket and continue up the overhang and through a set of underclings to reach the lip.# Protection
More than 3 pads and a good spotter would be ideal.
