# Description
Begin down in a drainage with a sloped left hand hold and a right hand pinch near head height. Move up the blunt arÃªte until you reach the lip. At this point there are two variations. The standard finish trends up and right, while an alternate finish skirts around to the left. Both variations require good sloper technique and mantling skills.# Location
The problem is located about 15 feet off of the pier trail. It begins in a hole between two garage-sized boulders.# Protection
