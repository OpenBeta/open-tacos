Begin standing with sloping feet and both hands on a square undercling at stomach/chest height. Initially move up and slightly left through crimps and slopers. Then pretty much straight up until you reach the slab arete which you ride to the top. The crux is fairly low.# Location
The northern block of the cave, facing Turtlehead Peak. It looks like fish scales, or leprosy.# Protection
Crash pads.
