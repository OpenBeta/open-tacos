# Description
The problem is on the left hand wall as you enter the cave. Sit start on the fin, with feet down in the hole and hands on the rail. Move up and right to a vertical rail. Then move up and left to a crimp out on the slab face. From the crimp, deadpoint to pinch on the massive detached shelf (it's not going anywhere). Slab on up. With the exception of the hard to pad start and the crumbly starting rail, there's great rock and movement on this one.# Location
Enter through the west side of the cave. You'll notice a sharp fin that runs the length of the cave along the floor. The problem starts sitting on the fin.# Protection
Crash pads.
