# Description
Crouch start low on a fin. Make a stretchy move up to a shelf. Dyno up and right to the square cut lip. Traverse left a few hand moves and pull over. The location and exposure of this problem make it both striking and thrilling. The rock is perfect and you can't cheat the dyno with intermediates.# Location
The right side of the cave's west entrance.# Protection
Many crash pads.
