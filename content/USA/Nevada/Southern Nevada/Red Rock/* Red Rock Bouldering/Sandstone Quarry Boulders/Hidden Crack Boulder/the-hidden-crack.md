# Description
The Hidden Crack climbs an off fingers and tight hand crack on a nicely overhanging boulder. Stand start gets you right into the buisness or sit start for steep finger locks that add a little more challenge to your day.# Location
Walk over the notch on the west end of the Wake Up Wall. Continue for roughly 100 yards until you can spot the crack facing you in a group of large blocks.# Protection
2 Pads would be nice to level the landing
