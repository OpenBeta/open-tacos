# Description
About 100 yards to the east of Trophy Wall sits this fun splitter crack boulder problem.  Trophy Crack starts hand size (if seated) but is mostly all offwidth climbing at a slightly overhanging angle. This is an excellent, although short, crack climb and will most likely provide a sufficient spanking for the grade.# Location
Keep hiking East past Trophy Wall for about 100 feet and look for a large boulder. On the opposite side of this boulder is the expanding OW splitter.# Protection
