# Description
Probably the steepest V3 in the area. Begin on huge underclings in the roof with decent feet. Make long reaches through the roof and pull over the lip on crimps and eventually good pockets. Awkward, tiered landing.# Location
On the opposite side of the Memento Mori boulder from the main problems.# Protection
