# Description
Tricky little crimp block with some powerful movement and various beta options. Stand start with a left undercling and right hand sidepull, climb the bulge up and left through crimps. Landing can be surprisingly intimidating until you have your beta, helps to have a blubber pad.# Location
This boulder is nestled between Americana Exotica and Lethal Design. Hike as for the rest of the Swirly Cliff boulders.# Protection
Pads, weird tiered landing makes blubber pads a nice option
