# Description
Super classic Red Rocks V12 with 25+ hand moves. Boulder itself is very crimpy and full of high tension moves. Spicy topout.# Location
Scramble up and around several boulders before reaching the obvious cave directly across from American Exotica.# Protection
Plenty of pads for the overhanging face and spotters/pads for the top out.
