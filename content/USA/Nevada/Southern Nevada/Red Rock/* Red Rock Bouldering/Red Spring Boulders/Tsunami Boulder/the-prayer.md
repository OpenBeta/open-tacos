# Description
The Prayer is the highly aesthetic overhanging arete on the southwest corner that makes the Tsunami Boulder so identifiable. Stand start on an OK crimp and a decent sidepull. Make some long moves towards the top and try not to let your feet skate. Move straight up the arete using the holds available. Straightforward, hard and very pleasing.# Location
