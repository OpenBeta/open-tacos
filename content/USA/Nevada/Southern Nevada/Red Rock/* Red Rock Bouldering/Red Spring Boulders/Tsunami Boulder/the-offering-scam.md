# Description
The Offering Scam is a pretty good problem with some funky movement to start that ends with some quality movement on good stone. This problem is found on the northwest corner of the boulder. Sit start (there is an option to stand start but the sit is more logical) using a good undercling and left hand crimp. Move up and make some pretty good moves using sidepulls and crimps. The crimps at the top are great and the mantle to finish is exciting- especially with a ankle breaker boulder below you should you blow it.# Location

A spotter and a pad is pretty nice.
