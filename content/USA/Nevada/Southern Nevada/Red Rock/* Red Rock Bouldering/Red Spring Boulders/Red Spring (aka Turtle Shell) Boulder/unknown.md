# Description
Start on two crimps at about face height, work up and left on more crimps, reach up and use small pockets and small feet to get over the lip, grab the large hueco jug, and finish by slabbing or beached whale to get on the very top (*a placeholder description to fit a route that I found in one of the guidebooks and then climbed; let me know if this is already a route on mountain project (can't tell if descriptions for Cherry Garcia or This V2 fit, no pictures)# Location
Start around the corner left of the large cave, work right towards Monkey Wrench, but go up before reaching any of its holds# Protection
A crashpad or two, especially one on covering the large boulder behind the crux
