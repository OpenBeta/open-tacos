Two hand sit start on a good hold. Move up, then right towards side pull jugs. Hit the pinch and make your way up, and left through the crux. Top out with easy down climb. Holds are solid, just watch for any loose stuff on top.# Location
Roughly 7min away from Tsunami Boulder. Continue uphill and to your left.# Protection
