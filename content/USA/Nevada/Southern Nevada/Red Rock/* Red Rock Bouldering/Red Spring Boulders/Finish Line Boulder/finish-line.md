# Description
Cave problem, all overhang and good quality rock once passed the jugs. Since your in a cave you have shade through out the day, but the sun hits the last few holds on the cave during midday. Never sees action since its a new route, you will however see trad climbers above you, which is always a plus. Hiker below you but never stray from the trail. On windy days can be bad, the wind pushes everything through the tunnel and sand in your eyes. Rated at a v4/5, Aaron Scruggs believe to have gotten the first ascent in May. I, Andrew La Combe got the 2nd. Both of us put time into working the problem with sand and rock crumbling, now its a solid line for anyone who want a cave problem with low fall.# Location
Enter Red Springs Picnic Area, head toward moderate mecca, cave problem is just below it about 30ft down. Easy way is to hike down to the bottom, follow trail until you are just below moderate and hike up to a big boulder leaning on another one. About 30ft up the hill, approach time about 15mins. Once there enter the little opening,you see a jug start on the inside right. Walk down to your right as well.# Protection
Two to three pads need with a spot.
