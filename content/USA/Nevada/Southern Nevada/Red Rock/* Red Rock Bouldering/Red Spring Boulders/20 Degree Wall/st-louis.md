# Description
St. Louis sit starts just to the left of the northeast corner of the boulder in positive and cool pockets. Get off the ground, and move right towards crimps. Hang on tight! The book rates this V4 but I disagree slightly. It's just my opinion, man.# Location
Northwest corner of St. Louis boulder.# Protection
