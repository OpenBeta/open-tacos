# Description
Start sitting on the jugs, climb up and left under the roof with super cool movement into a sweet juggy scoop, top out straight up over a low flat landing zone. Super cool movement on steep terrain. The inner skirt of the cave is off, keep it steep, don't dab.# Location
Directly across from the warm up boulder is this interesting cave feature.# Protection
