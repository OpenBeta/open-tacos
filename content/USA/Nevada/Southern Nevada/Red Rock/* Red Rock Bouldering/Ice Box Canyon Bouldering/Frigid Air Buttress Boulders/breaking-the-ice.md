# Description
Simple but a bit contrived because I consider all the left holds in between the starting jug and the lip all off. It's just a simple, fun dyno problem. Start with a nice jug in the middle of the small boulder then the crux is finding high feet on this water polished boulder to dyno to the lip.# Location
After heading towards Frigid Air Buttress by going through the wash, this boulder is right before the bend leading to the Tri-force boulder. It's right after the trail goes through the large boulder in the wash.# Protection
A pad is nice but not necessary..a spotter is necessary though because if you miss the dyno you might launch back into the wash and if you do that you want to make sure you land on your feet and not your neck.
