# Description
Start with a beautiful slug (sloppy jug) for your left and a nice incut crimp with your right. Work up and to the right to gain a nice sidepull while the whole time you have nice but spaced out slugs to your left. Work straight up to a incut crimp right below the lip, then work left to another crimp before making an exciting move to a sloppy pinch on the upper left of the problem, one more exciting move (crux mantel)..enjoy.# Location
Its directly up the beautiful seashell like face on the Tri-force Boulder..a boulder in the wash that is marked by the old triangle Tri-force symbol of the Zelda games...hence the name Tri-force. This faces the wash/trail to Frigid Air and its on the trail, in your face...so if u miss it, u should just go home.# Protection
A pad would be nice, however I snagged the FA without one because the large sand pit at the bottom acts as some pro.
