# Description
Stand start on the mini slab with left hand sidepull/crimp and right hand on a white sloper/pinch. The movement and rock on this problem are both fantastic. Sadly, the big boulder leaning against it takes away from the freedom of movement. Its tough not to dab. Jumping to the large sloper rail keeps the likelihood of dabbing much lower (than going statically). If not for the obstruction, this problem would easily be a classic of the grade.# Location
The northeast, overhanging and varnished face.# Protection
Crash pads.
