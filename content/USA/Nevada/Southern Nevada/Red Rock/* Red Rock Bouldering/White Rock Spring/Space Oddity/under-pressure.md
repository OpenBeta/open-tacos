# Description
Sit start with a good left foot, crotch against the arete, the lowest side pull crimp (like the climber in the beta photo) and high right hand sloper/pinch. Slap to the lip, traverse left a few feet and mantle it out. Taller climbers may have to use a higher left hand crimp to start. Jonah got the f.a. to the stand start, then his girlfriend Erika swooped in and scooped him on the f.a. of the much better sit start ha ha!# Location
