# Description
The rock is perfect and the moves interesting and sustained. Compression start like the climber in the photo. Left hand on the lowest flat hold, right hand on the side pull crimp, squeeze and right foot heel hook. Reminiscent of The Fountainhead in Black Velvet Canyon.# Location
The east face of the boulder.# Protection
Crash pads.
