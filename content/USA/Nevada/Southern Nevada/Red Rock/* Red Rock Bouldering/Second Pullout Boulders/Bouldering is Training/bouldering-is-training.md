# Description
A fun boulder problem at the end of the crag. Overhung with small but good holds. Start at chest level. The topout is easy but the rock is fragile and crumbly, so be careful. If you top out you'll probably get to scare some people watching the sport climbing by appearing out of nowhere.Beta:Start with very low feet. The crux is basically the first and second move. We did a right hand cross to a sidepull then made a reachy move to the next crimp. After than we cut feet and had to hold some mean swing. Then you have a few more small holds, then awesome jugs right before you pull the roof.# Location
Go to the far right side of The Gallery and step downhill a little. The route is the obvious chalked line up the bulge.# Protection
1-2 pads would be nice.
