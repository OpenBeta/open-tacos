# Description
The small and steep overhang with sandstone features spotlights this boulder problem. Sit start with hands matched on the juggy pinch. Work your way up the good side pulls to a shelf before making a big move to the lip. The high feet and mantle ontoÂ smooth features arguably makes it the crux of the problem.# Location
This problem can be found right before entering the narrow corridor and cave-like room of Friends and a Sunset.# Protection
