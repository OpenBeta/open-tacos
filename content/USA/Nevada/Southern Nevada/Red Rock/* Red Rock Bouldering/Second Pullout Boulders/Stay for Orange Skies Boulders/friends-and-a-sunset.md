# Description
A hidden gem. Starts at a big undercling flake and good feet. Make your way up the good side pulls to good crimp rails before topping out.# Location
At the top of the overlook, look for a soft but sketchy downhill to the next level of the overlook. You'll see a gap between the rocks on your left. At the bottom of the hill, turn left and walk into the gap which will open up to a small room. The obvious boulder problem is to your right.GPS:Â 36.156309, -115.436872# Protection
