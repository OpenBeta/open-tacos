# Description
A rare climb for the area. Unique limestone-like features and big moves leads to typical flaky sandstone topout. It took me more tries than I care to mention to finally square with the beta. I was convinced it was at least V6. Time will tell. Some of the top holds will likely still break when cranking on them but it's an easy top-out.# Location
