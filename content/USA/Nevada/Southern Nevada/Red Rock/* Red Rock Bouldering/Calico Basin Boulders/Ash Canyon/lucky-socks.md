# Description
This highball is a true hidden gem in Calico Basin. Tall, beautiful and sustained. It begins with a tricky campus start and follow a series of rails up and right to a good jug. The crux is right at the top and revolves around a long reach to a good crimp. Make one intermediate move and then commit to the top. Downclimb on easy terrain to the right.Beta Video:youtube.com/watch?v=y8u5J4Zâ€¦# Location
Approach from the Kraft boulders lot as if you were going to The Fringe crag. At the base of Ash Canyon, instead of veering left for the Fringe, stay to the canyon proper and follow a good trail up the hill near a dried creek bed. Aim at a gigantic boulder sitting in the middle of the canyon. You can't miss it. Lucky Socks ascends the overhanging face on the backside of the giant boulder.25 minutes from parking.# Protection
