# Description
A somewhat sandy and flaky 5.8 crack climb.# Location
From the Mr. Smiley boulders, head east (as you would for Everything But the Girl) skirting the base of the mountain on your left side. After about 3 minutes, you'll arrive at the mouth of a steep northwest running drainage. The crack will be on your left at the entry of the drainage.# Protection
Crash pads, or a rope and rack up to Camalot #4.
