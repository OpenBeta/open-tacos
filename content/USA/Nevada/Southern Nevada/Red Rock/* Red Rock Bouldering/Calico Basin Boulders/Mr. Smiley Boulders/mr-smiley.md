# Description
Start left at the lower sloper rail and gain the big obvious rail and slopey arÃªte. Move straight up through small edges and slopers. Top out.A super clean line with fun, unique movement and aesthetic holds. The crux is moving off the huge rail. Big moves that can feel reachy.Definitely worth the approach. Pretty good landing, just don't peel off left too hard.# Location
Located uphill on the east face of the Mr. Smiley Boulder. The boulder sits above Ash Creek Springs on the south-facing side of Ash Canyon and is recognizable from below as a large white block with a large horizontal crack. See Mr. Smiley Boulders area for detailed approach.# Protection
