# Description
The problem begins with a delicate sequence up the left arete of the boulder on fantastic rock, linking into the rad rail feature in the middle of the face. The moment of truth is a dynamic throw to the right arete, followed by a few easy exit moves.Beta video:youtube.com/watch?v=BLKSvtuâ€¦# Location
