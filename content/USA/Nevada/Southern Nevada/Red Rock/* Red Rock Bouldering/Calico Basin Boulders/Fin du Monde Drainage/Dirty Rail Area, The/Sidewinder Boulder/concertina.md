# Description
This deceptive problem climbs the right arete of the Sidewinder boulder directly. The sloped rail is tough to stick to and the feet are more or less imaginary. - As a side note, the name concertina refers to “the movement occurring in snakes that consists of gripping or anchoring with portions of the body while pulling or pushing other sections in the direction of movement.”# Location
