# Description
Sit start on the large undercling and climb the rail out of the roof using a combination of heel hooks, toe hooks, and core tension.# Location
From the Kraft parking lot, go west until you see the old foundation. Look for a trail going south (left) and then eventually west again (right) into the wash up the hill. Keep going up hill in the wash. It'll be on the right hand side. It's further than you think it is.# Protection
