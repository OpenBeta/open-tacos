# Description
The left hand starts at a small flake/crimp on the inset arete at shoulder/head height. The right hand starts above your head on a "v," crimp sitting along a swooping slope feature. Move up through flat slopers. The landing adds a nice level of excitement!# Location
Located on the downhill, south facing side of the boulder.# Protection
3+ pads and a spotter or 2 might not be a bad idea. Uneven, steeply sloped landing.
