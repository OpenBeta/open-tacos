# Description
A hilarious highball.   Good moves on rock that is way better than it looks.Start as deep as possible on the right wall.  Traverse on decent crimps and ample feet.  Just as things get serious the floor drops out and you pull around the corner.  Run it out to the top on 5.7 terrain.# Location
The right wall of The Breakfast Club# Protection
Crashpad and an active spotter to move it around.
