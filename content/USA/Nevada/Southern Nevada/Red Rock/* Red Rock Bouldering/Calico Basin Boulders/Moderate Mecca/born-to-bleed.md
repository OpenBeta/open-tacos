# Description
Start in the back of the A-frame roof on a perfect three hand letterbox slot.  Work your way through the roof crack to a stimulating OW finish.  A distinct departure from the usual Red Rock boulder problem...  Sort of remiscient of Spin To Win, but slightly more featured.# Location
In the boulders below Moderate Mecca.  It is the less than obvious A-frame roof formed by two boulders sitting together.  Unless you totally blow it, you will not fall in the yucca guarding the entrance.# Protection
Crash pad helpful.
