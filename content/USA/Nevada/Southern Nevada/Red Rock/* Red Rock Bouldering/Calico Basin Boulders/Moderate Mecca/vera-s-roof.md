# Description
Wide roof low to the ground just after entering the moderate mecca cliffband.  Start on crimps in the crack (easier) or a double-fist stack (harder).  Kick through to the lip to an easy topout.  Somewhat foot-size dependent, since it is about 8-9" most of the way (or just requiring good technique).# Location
