# Description
This unique crack offers something for the offwidth enthusiast or any individual looking for something different.  Start at the very back of the crack, and bury your feet up high.  Do a sit up and shuffle out the roof.  Pull the lip with a fun pivot and the help from a few edges.  Although not technically all that difficult, it is quite an enjoyable climb.  Additionally, there are probably numerous ways to climb this.This reminds me of a similar (but easier) sandstone version of Vedauwoo'sDesiderataV5. The name is a reference to that.# Location
Sitting near the wash below Alternative Crag is a large boulder split wonderfully by a tapering offwidth crack.# Protection
