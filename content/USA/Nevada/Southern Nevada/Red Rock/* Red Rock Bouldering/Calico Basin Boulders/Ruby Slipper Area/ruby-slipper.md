# Description
Do you like low ball, sloper traverses? Well then you are going to love this problem. Begin on the left (east) end of the boulder matched on a good jug and your left heel on the lip. Ride the lip of the boulder using subtle features until you can mantle out into a varnished dihedral on the far right (west) end of the boulder.Video:youtube.com/watch?v=yTRv8rUâ€¦;# Location
From the Kraft lot, follow the gravel road west, past the old building foundation. From here, hike up the flank of the mountain in front of you, trending up and right. The boulder will be hidden during the ascent, but will eventually come into view as you gain elevation. See the reference photo for more clarity.# Protection
