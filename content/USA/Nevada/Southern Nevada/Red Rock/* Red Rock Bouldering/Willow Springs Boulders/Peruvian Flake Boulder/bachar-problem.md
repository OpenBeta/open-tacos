# Description
Super delicate climbing up a thin crack# Location
Jumbled ultra-thin crack on the opposite side of the boulder from Peruvian Flake.You can see the Peruvian Flake boulder from the parking lot, but it's hard to pick out because it just looks like another random fin of rock and this problem is too thin to see from far away.# Protection
