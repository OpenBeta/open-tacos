# Description
It's all in the first two moves. Dynamic and weird movement on perfect sloping edges. FA called this V8 in his video, but it shows the right hand gaston crumbling. The current guidebook calls it V9. V9- should suffice, and feels about right.# Location
This is the first boulder you'll approach as you're walking up canyon. It's in a right facing corner with a massive house sized boulder to the left.# Protection
at least two pads. Uneven landing
