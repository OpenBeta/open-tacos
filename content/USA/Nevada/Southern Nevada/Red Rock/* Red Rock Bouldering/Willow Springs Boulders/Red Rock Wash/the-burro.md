# Description
Start on two slopers at headÂ height above the death rock. Make a move out right to a finger jug and figure out your way into the finish of Little Pony.I'm still unclear as to if this climb is a sit start on the death rock or a squat start. If someone could clarify that would be great!# Location
Right side of the same face of the boulder as Little Pony.# Protection
