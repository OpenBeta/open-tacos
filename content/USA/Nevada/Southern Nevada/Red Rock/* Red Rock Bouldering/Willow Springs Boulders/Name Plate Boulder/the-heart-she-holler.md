# Description
Stand start at a slab with left hand high in a down slanting seam, right hand on the arete, and right foot on a small rail on the arete. Move straight up to hand match on a u-shaped jug. Hang a hard left and traverse through the crux, followed by some exciting and airy campus moves on jugs. Pull around/over at the obvious notch, ending the traverse.# Location
The steep south face. Shares the start with 'A Red Heeler's Delight.' Begin at the right hand side of the boulder at the entrance to the Name Plate cave.# Protection
Crash pads.
