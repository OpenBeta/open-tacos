# Description
This problem shares a start with 'The Heart, She Holler.' Stand start at a slab with left hand high in a down slanting seam, right hand on the arete and right foot on a small rail on the arete's edge. Move straight up to a u-shaped jug for a hand match. Make a move up and slightly left, then continue over the bulge straight up the nice, low angled black varnish.# Location
The right hand edge of the boulder at the entrance to the Name Plate cave.# Protection
Crash pads.
