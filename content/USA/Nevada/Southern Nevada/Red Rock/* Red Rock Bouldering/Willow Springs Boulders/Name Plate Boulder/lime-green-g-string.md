# Description
From a sit start on a bridged pad, begin with hands at the same elevation on good holds at about face height. Small pocket for the right and any other good hold for the left. Climb up and slightly right through crimps and fins. Low crux.# Location
On the same boulder as Name Plate but a tier above. While directly in front of and facing Name Plate, turn to your left and enter the tunnel. At the point of convergence, stem up the boulders at the same point that you will fold the pad for your sit start. Climb the steep south facing overhang on the second tier.# Protection
Fold a crash pad in half to bridge the gap between two boulders and use as a sit start platform. Another pad or two to protect the ramp.
