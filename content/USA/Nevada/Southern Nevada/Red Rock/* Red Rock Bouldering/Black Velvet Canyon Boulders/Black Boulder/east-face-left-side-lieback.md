# Description
Start matched on the sloping left facing vertical rail (a 2" dihedral, if you will) and go straight up. Getting both feet off the ground while maintaining control is the hardest move but the excitement isn't over.While the rock quality on this boulder is mostly superb, the top of this face is probably the worst.# Location
East face of the boulder which faces the parking lot. As of 05/2018 there is a bush only a foot or two to the left of the start hold that blocks any more of this face to the left.# Protection
