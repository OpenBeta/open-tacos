# Description
This is a sweet traverse that starts just left of the main part of the cave with two hands on a really nice horizonal rail/crack at about head height. Power up to the next rail above it and keep traversing right till you are about middle of the face then shoot straight up on small fingers and pinches.I didn't finish this route as of 10/29/2019..so the FA is up for grabs...I think it goes around V2-ish. We were just visiting the area and it looked like a fun line to work on and it was!Two pads are really nice to have to keep moving them as the climber traverses.Have fun!# Location
