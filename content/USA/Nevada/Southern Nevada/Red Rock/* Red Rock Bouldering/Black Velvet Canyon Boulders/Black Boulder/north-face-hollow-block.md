# Description
Begin on an undercling on the overhung bottom of the boulder that may have a spider web in it. Reach up to the obvious ledge which is at eye level when standing. From here mantel the ledge and follow the seam that begins to angle up and left to a shorter side of the boulder.This ledge and the block it is formed by make a medium / high pitched ring when knocked on. This is the origin of the name.# Location
The route is left of center on the north face just in front of a 8' tall bush / tree that has been pruned to make the narrow pathway that is room enough for a person to walk but probably not quite enough room for most pads.# Protection
Pad or maybe just spotter
