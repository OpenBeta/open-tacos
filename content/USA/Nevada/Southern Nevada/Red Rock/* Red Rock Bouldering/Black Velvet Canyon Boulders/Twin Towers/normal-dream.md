# Description
Start with left hand near the bottom of the seam (below the 2 jug slots, see picture), right hand on right facing rail in the scoop. Be creative (hint: knee pad would help) or make strong moves to get your left hand in the highest jug slot in the seam. Make a hard move off a right hand pinch to get your left hand up high on a sloper rail in the seam. Move out right to a right facing jug in the middle of the boulder. A couple moves traversing left on jugs gets you on top.# Location
About 30ish yards behind Freedom Fighter. Easily distinguished by the two diagonal seams (//) going up the face of the boulder# Protection
3 pads
