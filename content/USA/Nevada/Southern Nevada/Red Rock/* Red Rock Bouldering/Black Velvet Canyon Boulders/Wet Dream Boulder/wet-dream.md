# Description
A case could be made for the most classic problem of the grade in the country. Shares a start with an easier version to the right where they both meet back up with each other at the horizontal crack for the daunting fingerlock move. A quintessential power endurance climb with multiple v8/9 moves and a heartbreaking finish as you throw for a blocky pinch off of two slopers about ten feet off the deck. Flat landing but bring many pads.# Location
