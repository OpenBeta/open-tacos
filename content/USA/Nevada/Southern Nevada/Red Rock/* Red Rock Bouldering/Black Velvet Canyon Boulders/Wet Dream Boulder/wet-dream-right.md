# Description
Probably one of the best boulder problems in Red Rock in my opinion. Crux is the opening moves. Sit start on two rounded crimps, moving up and right to better holds. At one point you get a sweet two finger lock to bump your other hand up to the lip. A V9 variation of Wet Dream Right can be done stand start on the jug. Bring plenty of pads for this one.# Location
