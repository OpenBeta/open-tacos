# Description
One of the better boulder problems at Oak Creek.  Aesthetic moves out the edge of a large roof lead to a deadpoint to a jug, and an easy topout follows.  Start on a sloping undercling under the roof and a good disk on the arete.While the Southern Nevada Bouldering book gives this problem a V9, I don't think it is even an 8; it is probably a bit easier thanBubble Buttin the Krafts.# Location
From the Bloodline boulder walk up and across the hillside along a faint trail in a northerly direction for 300-400 meters.  This problem faces downhill and is at the edge of a decent-sized roof.# Protection
Perfect flat & sandy landing.  One pad is helpful.
