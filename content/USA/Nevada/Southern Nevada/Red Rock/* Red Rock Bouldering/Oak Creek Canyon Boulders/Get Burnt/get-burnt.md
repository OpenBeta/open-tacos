# Description
A dyno problem on surprisingly grippy rock. The crux is not so much the throw, but holding the body tension required to stick the hold.Start on the obvious jug, move up into the crimp and throw for the lip.# Location
From the Oak Creek Canyon main parking area, follow the Knoll Trail towards the mouth of the canyon. At the black sign that says "Knoll Trail", continue straight. The climb lies on the hill a hundred feet or so of the short, tiered orange cliffs; cut right off the Knoll Trail and the boulder will be tucked on the hillside. It is closer to the trail than the American Boulder. GPS coordinates (36.103748, -115.483116)# Protection
