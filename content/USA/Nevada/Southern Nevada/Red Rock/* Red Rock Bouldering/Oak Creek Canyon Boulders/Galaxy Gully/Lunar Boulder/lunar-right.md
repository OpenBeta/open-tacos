# Description
Classic problem with back and forth side pulls and small tenuous feet with climbing that gradually gets harder.# Location
Start near the right arete on a right hand side pull then move up and left to a left hand side pull. After this aim to top out in the middle of the boulder.# Protection
One maybe two pads due to the height. Good landing.
