# Description
A much lesser quality line than its neighbor to the left, the eponymous Blood Trails, but something to do if you're here. Stand start on crimp at head height and make a very difficult pull up into the seam on smeary feet. Follow the seam to bigger, but maybe not better quality rock, holds to the top.This problem was originally V4 but apparently the low footholds have broken since SNBII was published making the start quite a bit harder. I wouldn't argue with V6.# Location
On the SE side of the boulder, just a few paces right of Blood Trails# Protection
Pads on the nice flat landing surrounding by yuccas
