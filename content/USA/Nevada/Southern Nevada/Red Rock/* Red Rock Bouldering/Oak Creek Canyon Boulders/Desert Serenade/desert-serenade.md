# Description
A clean, smooth arete on the uphill side of the boulder. The landing is small but level enough with two pads. Stand start with tricky, balancy arete climbing.# Location
Hike up the gully from Blood Trails and head up the small, right fork of the drainage to reach the Desert Serenade boulder on the right side of the gully.# Protection
Two pads are nice
