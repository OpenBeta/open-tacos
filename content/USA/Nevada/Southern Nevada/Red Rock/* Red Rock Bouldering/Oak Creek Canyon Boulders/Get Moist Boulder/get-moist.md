# Description
A quality, powerful climb. Start on a right hand crimp and left hand sidepull which are difficult to reach if you're short. The sit start, from low crimps, goes at V9. The problem faces away from the wash.# Location
The easiest way to approach this boulder is by following the same approach to Oak Creek Canyon and staying above and right of the wash. When you are nearing the start of the short, red cliff band on your right, you should see a large boulder directly right of the trail (see pic). On the opposite side of the trail (left), the top of the Get Moist is visible through the trees. It is also possible to hike up the wash until you the boulder comes up on your right, but you can't see the problem from the wash. GPS 36.10249, -115.48324# Protection
