# Description
A really fun, steep rail traverse full of jugs and heel hooks. Crouch start as low left as you can and follow the rail up and right to the finish through the obvious notch.# Location
South side of the boulder, in the gully.# Protection
A pad or two is plenty. It's a nice soft, low landing until the top out.
