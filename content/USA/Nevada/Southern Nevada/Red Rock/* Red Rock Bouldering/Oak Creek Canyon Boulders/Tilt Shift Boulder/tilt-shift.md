# Description
Sit-start on obvious low feature with left heelhook and crimps. Move up to the rail and continue to the top. Might be a little soft but don't get caught up in the grade, this is an amazing problem.# Location
Main line up the center of the boulder.# Protection
Best to have at least 3-4 pads and a spotter.
