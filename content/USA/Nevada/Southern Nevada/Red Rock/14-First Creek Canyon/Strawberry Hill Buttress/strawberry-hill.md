The second pitch starts with a boulder move onto the main wall and continues up the corner.  A few more pitches of mostly face-climbing take you to the summit.Go right (west) to the rappel route.# Location
As you approach the main buttress, bear right (west) on the slabs for 50 yards or so, until reaching an area of darkly varnished rock by a right-facing corner system.  Start here.# Protection
