# Description
On the far left (eastern) side of the Strawberry Hill buttress, there is a clean, right-facing corner.  Fourth class scrambling leads to a belay stance at its base.  Climb the corner, surmount the overhang above it, and continue to a belay ledge on the crest.  Face climbing leads to a a bigger ledge with some large bushes.  This point can also be reached by a crack system to the right (between this line andBerry Nice).  A black dihedral rises from this ledge.  Climb the dihedral with small cams for protection.  Two or three more pitches continue on easier climbing, joiningBerry Nicefor the cruise to the summit.  Walk right (west) to rappel.# Location
