# Description
Pitch 1 - Start in a crack and move up about 30'.  Step right and continue up to a huge  belay ledge.  This pitch has awkward climbing. The lower portion is kinda mossy so expect to get dirty! 80'Pitch 2 - Start in the corner.  Pull around the corner and through a roof.  This is the crux of the climb.  Once through the roof continue up on jugs to webbing.  The pro is not obvious through the roof though it's definitely there.  100'Pitch 3 - Climb the face/cracks on great pro. Once the rock starts to get iffy, make a traverse left on good holds to the base of a corner and belay. 80'Pitch 4 - Climb up the corner to a face.  Make some calculated moves on thin pro.  Work up and left on easy terrain.  This pitch might deserve a PG rating.  100'# Location
