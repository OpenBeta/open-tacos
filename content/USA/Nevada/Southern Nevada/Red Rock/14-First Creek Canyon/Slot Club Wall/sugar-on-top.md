# Description
Do not bother. 30 feet of nice jams in good rock surrounded by sand.Start up the wide approach crack to the Closet/Slot Club belay ledge, but then continue up the wide crack to the right. Tiptoe around the arete on the right (rope drag potential) and gain the hand/fist crack in the corner, which is followed to the tree ledge.If you rap from the tree, the rope likes to get caught in the collapsed columns.# Location
Start at the wide, easy crack where you put your packs down before scrambling up to the Closet/Slot Club belay ledges.# Protection
Standard rack; perhaps an extra #3 camalot
