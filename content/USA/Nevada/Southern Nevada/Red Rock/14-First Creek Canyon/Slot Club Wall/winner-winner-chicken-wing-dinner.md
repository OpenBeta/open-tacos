Pitch 1 (5.9+, 100'):Lightning-bolt 5" offwidth into a smooth chimney and then a gully with loose stones. Make a belay in doughy blocks before entering the cave.Move the belay 30' into the cave. The next pitch exits the right side of the cave. The left exit has insecure rock quality and is not recommended.Pitch 2 (5.8, 70'):Indiana Jones up the right side of the cave past a bulging block. Squeeze through a very tight hole to a stance before making a wild exit traverse. At the lip, a thin crack out right provides a directional placement to keep the rope out of the main crack. Walk 20' to a belay in a thin diagonal crack.Descent:Walk off left and circle back down a gully to the base of the wall. There is a short 4th-class step in the gully.# Location
