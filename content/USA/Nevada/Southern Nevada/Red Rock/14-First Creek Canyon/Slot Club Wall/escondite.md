P1: Up the corner/hand-crack; into the dark chasm; past some choss to lovely, featured varnish, to the light; belay on an ample ledge.P2: Tiptoe over the chasm and ascend the corner and lesser chasm to blocks. Behind, up an uninspiring 20’ of sandy crack (first gear in solid rock = #6, followed soon by #4) to a sloping ledge with small oak trees. Either rappel to the top of Coming of Age/Bighorn Campus Coffee House (<30 meter) or better yetP3: Scramble up ledges to the base of the crispy but fun #5 camalot corner crack; negotiate the move into the crack proper, climb it; up blocky terrain to a slung-block rappel.# Location
Start at an obvious 30’ dihedral in chocolate rock with a hand-crack in the back, below the entrance to a cave.# Protection
