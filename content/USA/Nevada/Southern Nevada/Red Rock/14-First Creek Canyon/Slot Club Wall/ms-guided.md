# Description
Sometimes friends, mentors, or lunatics (or all of the above) convince you to wander off the beaten path. Perhaps they brought you here.This route climbs a series of two varnished, left-facing corners to the right of Slot Club. From the slab at the base, you can place some gear low, which will at least keep you from rolling into a cactus. Once you pull into the corner, you can then try to get in an offset cam, but it likely wouldn't do you much good. Luckily for you, there are a number of great holds on the right. Unluckily for you, some don't look like they really want to stay attached to the rock (although I did try dislodging them without success). Either way, you use them gingerly, pull into the corner, place a finger-sized cam, and enjoy the rest of the corners, which involves fun stemming and big huecos. The second corner is a bit dusty. Either rappel from the scrub oak tree at the top of the climb (cord anchor as of Jan 2020, good with a 60M rope) or continue up a second tier climb like Polygon Petting Zoo.# Location
From the base of Slot Club, look right to find an alcove with a broken column in it. This broken column leans right, onto another column. The right side of that column forms the initial corner of Ms. Guided. Walk from the base of Slot Club to the base of the corner.# Protection
Standard rack to 3 inches. Offset cam (BD 0.4/0.5) may provide some false security for the starting moves.
