# Description
Slot Club is an adventurous flaring offwidth/corner on nice smooth stone.  The climbing requires a good amount of creative thinking and a little trickery to boot.  The general difficulties come from committing to the crack when the face holds completely disappear and the crux is negotiating a bulge.# Location
The right most of the three cracks on Slot Club Wall# Protection
.5 to 6 BD, doubles 4-6,  an additional 3.5 or 4 would be great to secure the belayer.Anchor is fixed gear and cord.  This routes bakes in the sun, bring  extra cord.   I would also not rap this with a 60m as it comes up sketchily short.
