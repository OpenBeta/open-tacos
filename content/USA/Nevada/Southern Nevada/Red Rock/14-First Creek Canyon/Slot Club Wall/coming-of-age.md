# Description
Start at the mouth of the claustrophobic corridor guarded by a small oak; up the crack in the face; up the wider crack in the left facing corner; at the big ledge, up the sustained left crack in the right facing corner; up the wide (right) crack to a ledge system.Sustained, hand size dependent crux; quality all the way.# Location
From the unpacking zone below the Closet/Slot Club belay ledge, hike climber’s right/downcanyon below a rock buttress and promptly back up.# Protection
Standard rack to #4. Extra thin hands and fists as desired. If you’re at the Slot Club wall, you probably brought 2 #4 camalots anyhow, so put them to use here too…
