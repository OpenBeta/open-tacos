# Description
On my account, you can climb this anytime it’s wet; somebody has to clean up the loose holds… Lots of sunshine on this one.P1 Up to the corner; follow this to the blocky ledge with a chasm in the back. Same belay as Escondite. 80’P2 Step right into the crack system/weakness; up to a steep section; up and right, following cracks, the weakness, and the best rock you can find. Crispy sections. Belay on a slopy, blocky ledge system. 120’P3 Up the right angling crack that starts wide hands and gets wider. 80’Descent: Slung block down and climber’s left from the top; two 30 meter raps—the first is a “long” 30 meters down Econdite's 3rd pitch to oak trees, a short rap to the top of Coming of Age, then one 120’ish rap to dirt.# Location
Start at a sizable oak tree in an alcove, several hundred feet right of Slot Club, down and back up; around the corner and up from Coming of Age.# Protection
Gear: normal rack; something(s) in the camalot #4-6 range at the top of the 3rd pitch.
