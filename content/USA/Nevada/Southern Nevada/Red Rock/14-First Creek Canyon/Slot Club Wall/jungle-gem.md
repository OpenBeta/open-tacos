# Description
A fun jaunt for the 5.10 leader; if you’re a budding 5.6 leader, watch out for ledge fall and rope drag. Stem up the chocolate rock, swing left under the roof, clamber up the left-facing corner/chimney, and enjoy the right-facing corner to the top. Walk back to a tree.Walk/scramble down to the left. The descent is easiest along the skier’s right wall; there’s a short downclimb at the bottom.# Location
Down and left of Escondite/Humidity Police Fugitive is a recess with three short cracks;  Jungle Gem is the center crack & stem-fest in the middle of the recess.# Protection
