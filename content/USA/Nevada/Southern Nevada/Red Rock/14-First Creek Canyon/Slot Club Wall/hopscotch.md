# Description
A tricky corner (jam? stem?) and then an easy romp to the top, with an optional detour for the curious. Belay from a tree.  In my school, hopscotch was for girls: difficulty will be hand size and crack technique dependent.Walk/scramble down to the left. The descent is easiest along the skier’s right wall, there’s a short downclimb at the bottom.# Location
Down and left of Escondite/Humidity Police Fugitive is a recess with three short cracks; Hopscotch is the left facing corner and fingers/thin-hands crack at the right side of the recess.# Protection
