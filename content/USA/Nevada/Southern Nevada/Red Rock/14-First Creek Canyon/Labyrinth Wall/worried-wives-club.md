# Description
This route begins just above the First Creek Slabs descent gully.  Start up a wide crack leading past a large bush (this is also the beginning of the Guinness Book), and bear left when possible to belay beneath a big, left-facing corner.  Three pitches lead up the dihedral.  The third involves strenuous liebacking to a small ledge.  Above this point the corner becomes unprotectable, but an improbable escape to the right allows progress to a large ledge.  From the left end of the ledge, follow the chimney system for several pitches to the summit ridge.# Location
