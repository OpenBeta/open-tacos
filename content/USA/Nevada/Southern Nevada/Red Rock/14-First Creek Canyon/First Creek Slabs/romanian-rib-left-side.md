# Description
This is a nice route that is generally easy climbing and short cruxes.  It's only drawback is crispy holds in a few places.  It can be most easily identified by a noticeable dark cresting-wave-like roof on the 3rd pitch.  The first 4 pitches are long, clean, and fun.  Above the route weaves through a series of aretes and buttresses.Pitch 1: Climb up the face finding the path of least resistance.  195ftPitch 2: Continue up and left up to a roof in a left facing corner.  Pull the roof and belay.Pitch 3: Continue up the crack below the wave-like roof.  Traverse right on brown varnished rock to a crack at the right side of the roof.  Continue up through the roof and belay in the crack above.Pitch 4-7: Continue up the crack and face to a tree.  From the tree move up and left around a buttress to a crack.  Continue up this crack to the top in about 2 more pitches.# Location
This route lies just to the left of the Hotflash gully on a buttress which is bordered on the left by a bushy gully.Descent: Use the usual First Creek Slabs descent.# Protection
