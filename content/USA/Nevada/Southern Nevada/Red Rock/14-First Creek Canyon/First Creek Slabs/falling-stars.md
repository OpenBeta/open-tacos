# Description
At the lower left corner of the First Creek Slabs, the pillar of Rising Moons lies against the main face.  Rising Moons goes up the right side of the pillar.  This route follows the left (eastern) side of the pillar to join Rising Moons at the top of its second pitch.  The protection is not terribly good.# Location
# Protection
Single set of cams.  A bigger than normal cam (number 4 Camalot or bigger) may come in handy.
