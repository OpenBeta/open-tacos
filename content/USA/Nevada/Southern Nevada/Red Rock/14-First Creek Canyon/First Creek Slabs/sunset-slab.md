# Description
A beautiful and moderate route up the First Creek Slabs. Once you step out onto the slab proper, its nothing but perfect climbing up a 600' crack, followed by easy face climbing and an exciting hand crack finish. Well worth doing!# Location
Start about 30 yards right of Rising Moons in an obvious gully that ends about 50' above the base of Rising Moons. Start up the dihedral on the right hand side of the gully before moving out left onto the slab near the bush on top of the buttress to your right.# Protection
gear to 3" is fine.
