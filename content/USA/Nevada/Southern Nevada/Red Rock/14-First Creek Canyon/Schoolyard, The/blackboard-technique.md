# Description
Fun face and crack climbing on black patena flakes. It will take some more traffic to clean up the crispy edges; that said, overall the rock quality is pretty darn good.Descent: Downclimb to the Coffin Corner anchors. Rappel with 2 ropes (We had a pair of 60 m ropes; donâ€™t think a single 70 would suffice).# Location
40 feet left of Coffin Corner on top of a pedestal in front of the blow hole.# Protection
This pitch eats gear: green alien  #4 camalot, heavy on the fingers to thin hands; lots of nuts; shoulder slings; we found double ropes to be convenient.
