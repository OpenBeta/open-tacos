# Description
Just to the right of Deja Vu, a thin crack wanders up the face.  After the first few moves, the angle eases.  There is now a rappel anchor near the top of the crack. A single-rope rap (60m works) will get you down.  Alternatively, you can continue up and left, on lower quality rock, to a small ledge and rappel from the slung chockstone.# Location
