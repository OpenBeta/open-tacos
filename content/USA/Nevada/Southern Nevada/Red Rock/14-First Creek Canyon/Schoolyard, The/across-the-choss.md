# Description
Start up sometimes frighteningly chossy patina, with descent protection, as it follows a right arching crack until it hits an obvious clean wide right leaning Crack at about 40 feet. Climb this until it hits a ledge and the back wall. There is a small ledge about 3/4 of the way up to split it into two pitches if the rope drag is to heavy.  Looks like you could continue up and left from the top for a short second pitch at a similar grade, but we rappelled from two nuts in a small alcove about 5 feet down and right. We used double rope but a 70 meter might work as well.# Location
Start about 20 feet right of coffin corner.  Aim for the obvious wide right leaning crack about 40 feet up.# Protection
We brought double .3-4 with an extra 2 & 3, A five could be used if you have one
