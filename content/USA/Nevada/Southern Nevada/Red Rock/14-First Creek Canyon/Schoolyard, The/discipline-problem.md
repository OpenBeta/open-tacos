# Description
Up the corner & the arete on its left; continue up the face above aiming for the face right of a short 4” corner; grab the jugs at the top of the corner and up again; step left to the Jedi rappel. Slightly easier and slightly better protected than Improbable Prose.# Location
Start at the small, right facing corner halfway between Return of the Jedi and Improbable Prose.# Protection
3 x nuts, roughly BD #3=>#8 sizes; include offsets. Cams, lots, tiny to 1”ish, offsets too; maybe one of each 1”-2”. Double ropes handy. Lots of gear; lots of runners/draws. PG rating because all of it is pretty small & patience to place it all.
