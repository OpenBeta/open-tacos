# Description
This route climbs the very thin crack system on the edge of the face, about 30 feet to the right ofReturn of the Jedi.  A few awkwardly balanced moves get you to a good ledge about thirty feet up.  Follow the crack up and right.  Protection is adequate, but involves a bit of work to arrange.  When the crack finally peters out, it appears that you could traverse left to easier ground and reach the low rap anchor on Return of the Jedi, but this would expose the second to quite a swing.  Better to make one more hard move straight up and belay in the varnish directly above the crack.  A very short, easy, traversing second pitch then gives access to the rappel point.# Location
