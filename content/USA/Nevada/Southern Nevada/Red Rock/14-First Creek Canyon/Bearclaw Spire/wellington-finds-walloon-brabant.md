# Description
Fun and solid climbing for the most part. The crux comes near the top as the crack flares open with your last piece in the sandy crack below your feet. Commit to some sandy face holds and move up to the next good jam and place for gear.# Location
Start at the right facing corner to the right of Clyde finds Wellington (also its lower rappel line)# Protection
A wide range of cams from tiny (.1/.2) to #4. offsets are nice but probably not necessary.
