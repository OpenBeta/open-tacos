# Description
Claw up to the bomb-bay 9" slot; valley giants 9 and 12 can be placed here. Up; many options, all contorted; crux. Continue up the wide crack/chimney in the corner. When a finger and hand crack heads up & right on the right wall, escape that way. Nut/chicken-head rap anchor. If this were next to Ragged Edges, it would get climbed and deserve an additional star. Given it's location, not sure anyone will climb here, let alone find the start...# Location
Follow the directions to Playing on Credit, but don't cross the chasm on the tree. The off-width/chimney corner will be all too obvious.# Protection
one of everything to 12"
