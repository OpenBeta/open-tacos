Excellent crack and chimney climbing. Climb the slot to a first roof, which is turned by face climbing on the sides; up the crack, a little above the 2nd roof is a possible belay stance; continue up the now wide crack. The oak trees guarding the slot at the start have been sawn, not recently; if there is a name for this climb and/or first ascent info, let me know & we’ll include it in the entry.Rappel with double ropes from bolted anchor with rusted chains 60 feet to climber’s right, down to bolted anchor at the base of The Maw, which includes a significant pendulum to rappeler’s right. Rappel to terra firma.# Location
This is the 3rd crack system left of The Maw. It starts on a pedestal at the back of a narrow slot in black rock guarded by an oak tree.# Protection
