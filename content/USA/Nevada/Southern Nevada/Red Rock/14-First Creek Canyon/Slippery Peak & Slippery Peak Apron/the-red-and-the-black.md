# Description
Start in the middle of the red slabs, 80 yds left of a huge left-facing corner at a crack system.P1 follows a crack system up to a belay at a bush.  This pitch has the best gear of all 3 pitches, which is not saying much.  There is crumbly loose rock.  The belay is marked by a small bush and marginal small placements in a crack.  5.7 130 ft.P2 continues above for 130 ft.  This pitch is marked by loose/crumbly rock for pro and runout slabs.  There is a huge detached flake that I had to stand to move up face.  Belay 20 ft under a ceiling with some large hexes and #2 or #3 Camalot in a flake.  5-6 140 ft.  Swain's guide did not give it an R but it is runout for 50 ft on slabs in one section.P3 continues through roof section with another roof to follow 40 ft up, then 100 ft of slab climbing with a few marginal gear placements in crumbly rock.  5.5R 165 ft.  Belay at a tree.Descent:  Traverse left and up to a slung tree above Real Domestic Chickens.  Double-rope rappel to top anchor of Real Domestic Chickens.  2 more double-rope rappels to the ground.# Location
