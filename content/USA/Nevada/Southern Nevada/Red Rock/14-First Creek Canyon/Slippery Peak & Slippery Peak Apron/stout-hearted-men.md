# Description
This route is not on Slippery Peak itself, but on the adjacent Raven Buttress.  Hike and scramble up First Creek, passing beneath the sprawling Slippery Peak Apron.  Immediately beyond, the canyon branches.  From the fork, the Raven Buttress can be easily seen as the rounded promontory overlooking the left (southern) branch.  Scramble up to a ledge with a few pine trees at the base of the buttress.Climb into, and follow, the right-facing corner system for a few pitches to a good ledge at the top of an obvious tower.  The headwall is passed by traversing left to a right-leaning crack system which leads up to the very large Crow's Nest Ledge.  At this point the route becomes less steep, and a few hundred feet of class four climbing lead to the top of the buttress.  Hike left along the contact with the grey limestone until you can climb up to the ridgetop leading east.  Follow this over the summits of Indecision Peak until a third class descent can be made back to the desert.  For a less adventurous descent, you can go right (west) along the Crow's Nest Ledge to regain the approach canyon.This route is named in memory of the irreplaceable Lee Stout, who was taken from us way too early.# Location
