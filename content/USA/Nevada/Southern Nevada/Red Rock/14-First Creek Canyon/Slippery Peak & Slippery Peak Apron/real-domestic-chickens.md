# Description
A sleeping classic and one of the best friction climbs in Red Rocks. The name Real Domestic Chickens is a play off of Dream of Wild Turkeys and it is every bit as good. Do this route!P1 (150'): Begin from two white boulders leaning against the wall and climb to a high first bolt, generally aiming for the right edge of a long, shallow roof at 70'. Pass six bolts and gear placements to a bolted anchor at a stance. If you blow clipping the first or second bolt only an attentive belay will keep you off the ground.P2 (80'): Difficult friction climbing past two bolts leads to a bolted anchor on a good ledge.P3 (130'): Climb past two bolts (original anchor was at the second bolt). Continue up a 50' stretch of unprotected climbing following, but just left of, a shallow right-facing corner that arches back to the right to a bolt below the long roof at the top of the wall. Pull the roof at a crack and belay on a good ledge at a bolted anchor.Continue easily to the top or rap with two ropes. You might be able to get by with a single 80m but some shenanigans/down-climbing will be necessary. When rapping P3 be careful to pull the ropes way to the left - and give them a well-timed flick - or they'll get stuck in some giant stacked blocks on the right. It is easy to climb up and free them if necessary but be careful not to dislodge the blocks.# Location
This route climbs the nicest, smoothest section of Slippery Peak Apron - the large slab of rock visible from the TH deep in First Creek Canyon and immediately past the Slippery Buttress.# Protection
