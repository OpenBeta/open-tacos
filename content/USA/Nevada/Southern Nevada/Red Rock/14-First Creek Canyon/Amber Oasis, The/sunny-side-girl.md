# Description
This thing is so good.  Thin start to a hand crack.  It's hard to find a #2 crack harder than 5.10, but this thing is steep enough for a moment to warrant it in my opinion.Above the steep (and sharp!) bulge the climbing eases into a wide #5/#6 crack surrounded by huge hugs(jugs!) in the 5.8 range.  Bump a big cam and place intermittent gear and sling horns as backup.Above the easy stuff one final treat awaits.  A short offwidth in a flared corner gets you home to the belay ledge and bomber rope anchor.# Location
Just right of Amber Oasis.  Aesthetic steep handcrack.# Protection
Singles .2-6. 3-4x #2.  Double #3.
