# Description
Yet another harder-than-it-looks crack. Though in places it is wide, stemming will prevent the need for true struggling. In places it is a little sandy & fragile. Up the crack to belay on ledge below oak trees. Escape (5.6ish) up and (climber’s) left past oak trees to rappel station above Sunny Side Girl.# Location
Start in a cleared area below a big oak at the base of the 4th crack on the left (east facing) side of the Amber Oasis corridor.# Protection
