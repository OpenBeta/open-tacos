# Description
Stellar, overhanging hand crack to thin hands and then offwidth/chimney finish.If rappelling in a single rap to the ground, arrange the pull so the rope doesn’t pile up on the ledge and rubble system at the start of P2; possible 2nd rappel from oak trees on ledge system at the start.# Location
The obvious, overhanging crack in a tight corner that starts on the ledge system about 60' off the ground, across the corridor from Amber Oasis and Sunny Side Girl. Gain the ledge via one of three options. Nut anchor.# Protection
gear is hands, thin hands, very thin hands (camalots .75-3; metolius in between sizes useful); then chimney. Red and gold camalots for the belayer’s anchor at the start. A #6 camalot can be placed where the very thin hands become a chasm but may get in the way of the climbing; a #3 camalot may be reassuring 2/3 of the way up the upper chasm. ½”-1½” cams/offset cams, and/or 3-6” cams can back up the fixed nut rappel anchor.
