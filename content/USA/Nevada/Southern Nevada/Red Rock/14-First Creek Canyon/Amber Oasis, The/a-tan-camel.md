# Description
It’s a long mile you’ll be walking for this one. Fun climbing; too short and contrived to be a destination, but if you’re looking for a short warm-down at the end of the day, this could be it. Too bad it’s not next to Topless Twins…Gain the black face by an awkward ramp, a step right onto the face below the black face, haul on the jug to the crack on the right to the ledge below the black face, and over the bulge.The descent is a work in progress; we down-led 150’ to the level of the Slot Club Wall walk-offs. It may be easier to continue upward to a rappel anchor on the climbs to the left or down-climb the  short cracks on the left.# Location
This is the gorgeous black face with a grid of cracks, on the (climber's) right low in The Amber Oasis corridor. It is just right of a recess with a pair of short cracks.# Protection
