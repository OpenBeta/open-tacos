# Description
Intriguing moves up the face to gain the corner/crack; intriguing moves up the crack; step right onto the ramp/corner, possibly intriguing; intriguing moves up this; step back left with good feet and left/up to the curious “I should have brought the #6” triangular cutout; intriguing moves up out of the triangle and past exquisite black rock; traverse left to the Shadow Corner/Silk Road ledge system. Rappel from oak trees or continue up another route.# Location
Start at the toe of the tower, 20’ below a shallow corner/crack; about equidistant from chimney slots on either side.# Protection
Gear to 4”. Extra nuts, tiny/small cams, offset cams; plenty of runners/draws; double ropes useful. I was glad I had two .5 camalots; in retrospect, glad I didn’t bring the #6...
