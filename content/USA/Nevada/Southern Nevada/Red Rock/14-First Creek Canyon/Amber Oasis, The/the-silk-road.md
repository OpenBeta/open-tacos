# Description
A nice line that is marred by P2’s poor rock quality at the crux and a sizeable block perched on a sloping ledge.P1 Gain the far (climber’s) left end of a ledge system at a clump of oak trees—left variation is chimney & crack w/ start in oak trees, right variation is face climbing just left of a chockstone filled chimney guarded by fewer oaks; possible belay. Continue up the corner and the ramp to climber’s left of the corner. Belay at base of black headwall; if continuing up, position the anchor out of the way of catastrophic rockfall. Possible escape left to A Horse with No Name or rappels from oak trees.P2 Up suspect cracks in the corner; tiptoe around the block; up a narrow ramp a few feet; up the steep corner to easier climbing arching out left. Up a wide crack; traverse right to belay on spacious ledges.The descent is a work in progress. 150’ downlead will get you to a rappel anchor above the possible oak tree belay of P1# Location
Start uphill from A Tan Camel at the base of either of two obvious chimney systems guarded by oak trees.# Protection
