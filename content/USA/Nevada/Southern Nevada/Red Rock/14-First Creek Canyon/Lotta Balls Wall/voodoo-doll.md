# Description
Start immediately to the left of Black Magic.  If you're a purist, you can actually do this without the Black Magic start, and skip the Black Magic bolts.Pitch 1: Climb the right-facing corner straight up, continuing past some awkward flakes to easier face climbing.  Up and slightly right, an old bolt protects a face move into a fingertip crack in a darkly varnished face.  When the crack ends, a few easier moves take you straight up to the first belay station on Bruja's Brew.Pitch 2: Go straight up 10 feet.  At this point Bruja's Brew continues upward over unprotected scoops; instead move right a short distance to a very thin crack.  Climb this, then arc to the right, eventually reaching the second belay ledge on Black Magic.Pitch 3 & 4: Follow Black Magic out past its jutting "nose" and on to the top.Descend left with a couple of short rappels.# Location
