# Description
From  the start of Dodgeball, scramble up a hundred or two feet of third class to a belay at the base of the main corner.  Rope up here.  The corner immediately becomes an interesting, smooth squeeze chimney.  Shortly above the chimney, the main corner branches, with a smaller, subsidiary corner splitting off to the left.  Pull over a small bulge and climb the left-facing corner to a small stance at its top.Continue up the corner system with much questionable rock.  Above a short offwidth section, the crack ends beneath a towering fin of rock.  The faint of heart or strong of mind might take this opportunity to step right and continue up the right-facing corner near the top ofDodgeball. The alternative is face climbing directly above on the runout slab.  This would be a thought-provoking lead even if the rock were solid and the lichen absent.  In light of the actual conditions, the lead is positively engrossing.  Above the fin, climb up and right on easy terrain to the top of the buttress. Descend as forDodgeball.# Location
