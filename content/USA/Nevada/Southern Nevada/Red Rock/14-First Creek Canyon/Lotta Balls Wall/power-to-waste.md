# Description
The left side of the Lotta Balls Wall is dominated by a huge fin of rock.  This route climbs straight up the fin to a bolted rappel station beneath the jutting overhang.  A single rope is sufficient for the rappel if you go down the east-facing wall (instead of straight down the route).  The route starts with easy face climbing on excellent rock.  When you reach the corner halfway up, the rock quality begins to decline, and care is needed as you approach the belay.# Location
