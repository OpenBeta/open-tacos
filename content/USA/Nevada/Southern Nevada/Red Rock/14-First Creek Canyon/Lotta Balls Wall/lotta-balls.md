# Description
Lotta Balls is a very unique route.  Although not that long as far as Red Rocks trad routes go, it has very good climbing.  Do the 45 minute approach to the Lotta Balls wall from the First Creek Trailhead.P1) Climb up horizontal crack features on the huge leaning boulder.  Once on top of the boulder, climb the left facing corner and up a flake system to a fixed anchor on a small ledge (bolted anchor).  (5.6)P2) Climb up the namesake section of the rock.  There is no crack here, only a lotta balls. Two bolts are in place for protection.  Pinch and edge on the really cool ball shaped holds for about 25 feet.  This section can be a bit spicy.  Then follow a corner to a large ledge. (5.8)P3) Climb up the corner above the ledge, then traverse left and climb a crack to the top.  This pitch is a full rope length.Descent: Descend down the gully to the left side. Do 3 rappels from trees and scramble the rest.  This descent is pretty quick and straight-forward.# Location
