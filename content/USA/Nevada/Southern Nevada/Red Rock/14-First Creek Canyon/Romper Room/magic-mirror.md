# Description
Starts in the obvious big left facing corner just to the right of Kindergarten Kop. Start up the easy, right-leaning ramp, then gaze in trepidation up the steepening corner above. Its easier than it looks, but the crux (an awkward jamming move without much for the feet) felt a bit tougher than 5.5.# Location
Descend via 2-rope rap down the line of Kindergarten Cop (shared anchor).# Protection
It is a long climb, and protects well, so the beginner leader can take a huge rack and sew it up - the big crack in the corner swallows up gear to #4 cams. As of Sep 2011, the bolts at the anchor are 3 iffy bolts with rusting cold shuts (spinners all), and could do with replacement.
