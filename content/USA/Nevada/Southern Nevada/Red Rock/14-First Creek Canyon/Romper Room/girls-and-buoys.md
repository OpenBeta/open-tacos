# Description
From Guise and Gals, continue under the boulder and around the corner to find the start of Girls and Buoys.  Good climb for a 5.5.  Start in the left most of three corners at ground level and climb about 40 feet to a ledge.  Step left into the first corner and continue to the anchors.  The crux is stepping into the upper corner Â– the climbing is easy, but the pro is a little thin in spots, especially as you move higher.  Fun, thoughtful route.  (There is a 5.4 variation that climbs the second corner to the left from the ledge.  It can also be reached by starting on Guise and Gals and traversing to the right.)# Location
