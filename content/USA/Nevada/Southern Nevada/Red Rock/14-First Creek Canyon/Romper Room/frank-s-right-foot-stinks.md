# Description
Great face climb (TR) to the right of the Romper Room route. This is on solid rock with interesting face moves. Fun, continuous climbing. Highly recommend! The crux moves may be a bit height dependent.It would be great if a TR anchor could be added at the top of this route. The route has mild swing potential if TRing off the Romper Room anchors. Also, the quality of the route probably justifies adding a separate anchor.# Location
Right of the Romper Room route.# Protection
TR off the Romper Room anchors.Given the quality of the line, it would be a good candidate for having lead bolts added.
