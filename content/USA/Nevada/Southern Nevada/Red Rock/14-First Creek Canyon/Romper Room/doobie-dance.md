# Description
This climb goes up the left side of the steep, rectangular patch of black rock in the Romper Room Area. Finger cracks, varnished plates and large jug holds bring you to the top. Well protected. Rappel from a two bolt anchor with one 60m rope. This is a good climb for the beginner leader.# Location
