# Description
This is a relatively brittle route that, with a few more ascents, could become an amazing route in the First Creek area.  It is a great combination of face climbing, overhanging jugs, and a crack that requires all of your creativity to complete.  It begins on "Doobie Dance"  on the Romper Room wall.P1: After climbing up Doobie dance, continue up the left leaning crack through 2 roofs (brittle) to a small nook and belay from there, .75-2 for the anchor 5.9 150 ft.P2:Continue up the crack to a bush. 5.8 140 ftP3:The money pitch! Continue up the crack using fingers, hands, fists and anything you can to make your way up the crack.  The crux is a thin crack to a fist jam 3/4 through where the feet disappear on a polished face, and the gear becomes thin.  Protect with a #6 or #7 stopper or small cams.  Make your way through the jam to a slight off width, protected with #4 or #5 Camalot.  Continue through the disappearing crack to some thin face climbing.  Watch out for the "cactus crux" at the end.  Belay from a ledge.  5.10c 180 ftP4: Continue up and to the left to a crack and a ledge at the top of the route. 5.9 60 ftNote: It is also possible to continue up and right after the cactus crux pitch, however daylight motivated us to do a shorter last pitch.# Location
