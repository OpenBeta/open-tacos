# Description
If there is a crux it would come up by the 3rd bolt in a one move thin section of rock.  Could be the best route on the wall IMHO and should not be missed!  Really killer start to climb and then just super consistent great climbing with some really fun run-outs that really are not too bad!# Location
Located just right of Girls and Buoys and ten feet left of Magic Mirror just underneath the right side of a triangular shaped roof.  Follow thin crack to roof, place some gear, then pull roof to first bolt!  Rappel with TWO ropes to get down!# Protection
This is a mixed route with 4 protection bolts with homemade hangers along with some required gear placements and fixed anchors and slings up top!  Probably not the best route for beginning trad climber to learn the craft as some placements are a bit crafty.
