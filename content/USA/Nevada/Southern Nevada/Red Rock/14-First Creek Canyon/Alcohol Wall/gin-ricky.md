# Description
A proud and beautiful line, Gin Ricky ascends the prominent right facing dihedral located on the left hand side of the Alcohol Wall. While it does have a distinct crux section, endurance is the name of the game on this route.# Location
This route is the obvious, clean dihedral just to the right of the Lotta Balls wall.# Protection
A healthy rack, emphasis on small gear (stoppers and cams). Two ropes to rappel.
