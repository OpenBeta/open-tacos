# Description
Start 20 feet below and 15 feet left of a left facing corner system.  Use the big cams you've been carrying in your pack for the belay anchor on this large, albeit exposed ledge.  Move up the right trending features past the first bolt to a roof formed by the start of the left facing hanging corner.  A blue alien protects the entry into this corner (somewhat spicy to and past this point, PG-13).  Let the fun continue as you move up this left facing corner for the remainder of the pitch.  Once established into the corner the pro is good.  Wherever the crack closes down, there is a bolt you'll gladly clip.  A nice ledge with anchors at the top of the pitch.  150' rappel puts you back at the base.# Location
