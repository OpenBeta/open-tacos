# Description
The lower pitches are nothing special but the upper wall was quality all things considered. We climbed it in 6 pitches.Lower wall: Best climbed in 3 pitches at about 90'-110'. There are two "tiers" of big ledges between lower/upper wall. I included scrambling up to the second tier in my last pitch(150').Upper wall: We climbed this in 3 pitches: P4-Climb up directly under the big corner to a belay on a decent ledge at about 40'. 5.4P5- Up through the corner. Plenty of big holds and continuous protection options up to the crux where I went up left on the face instead of slithering up the flare. 150' 5.6P6- Continue up the crack and follow the corner left and top out. 60'. 5.5I suspect that 2 60m pitches would be best for the upper wall.Descent: We rappelled and scrambled down the gully between Mudterm area and here. Primitive how I like it. If I went back I would rap the entire route leaving only webbing behind. One could also descend as per other routes on formation, West gully. Â Probably the easiest descent is to scramble east and go down a gully (class 2-3) that comes out nearThe Schoolyard.# Location
When facing Mudterm area this route is on the large formation a few hundred yards back and right.# Protection
