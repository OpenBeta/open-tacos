# Description
Destined for non-classic status due to rock quality (one star might be generous), this is still a natural line with some cool moves.Follow a stembox for 20’ or so, then move up right on ledges below an obvious bulge. Pull the bulge, then follow the corner to the tree. Watch out for loose rocks and a few friable holds near the top.# Location
The left side of the alcove that holds Moody’s Move holds a right-facing corner with finger and hand cracks. Follow the rubble-filled gully up to the base. One-rope rappel from an oak tree (webbing and quicklink).# Protection
Standard rack to #4; extra #0.5-1 might be nice. Tree anchor.
