# Description
Lucky Nuts is the most prominent route in the Mudterm area- in the large white corner, there is an arching flake system that arches up and left to meet with another large flake to form a corner. Climb up this part, then follow the corner to a ledge. From here, move up, then right and up to belay. This route is fairly sustained and was originally led with passive gear in 1977!# Location
# Protection
Generally standard rack to 4", lots of slings fairly useful, large cams for belay.
