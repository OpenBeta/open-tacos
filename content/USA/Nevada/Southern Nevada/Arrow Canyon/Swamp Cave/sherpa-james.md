# Description
This is a decent route which is steeper than it looks.  Good easy 5.10 climbing leads to a powerful move to a pocket getting over a high bulge.  Chain anchors.# Location
The first route right of Twist of Fate.  Climb low angle rock in a vague left-facing corner to a high first bolt.# Protection
Draws only.
