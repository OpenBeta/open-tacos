# Description
Of the four main routes on the right side of the Swamp Cave this is the left most.  This classic route starts out with a challenging boulder problem which leads you through a steep section of rock. Once through this section you enter a long stretch of sustained face climbing.  AMAZING route!# Location
There are four routes that are on the right hand side of the cliff, this is the left most of those.# Protection
