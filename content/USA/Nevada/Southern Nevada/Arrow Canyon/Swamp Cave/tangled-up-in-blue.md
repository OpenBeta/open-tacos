# Description
A killer route featuring a variety of interesting movement and cool holds. Some of the hardest climbing is right off the deck; move through three bolts of slippery, powerful climbing to a mini ledge rest. From here the climbing style changes character, using a mix of crimps, pockets and the rare jug. The climbing is technical and engaging on bullet stone. Quite solid for the grade.# Location
on the right side of the swamp cave. This route is just right of 'Shelter from the Storm' and just left of 'Heart of Glass'.# Protection
