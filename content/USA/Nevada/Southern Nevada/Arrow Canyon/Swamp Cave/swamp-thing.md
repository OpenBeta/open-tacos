# Description
A burly route. Hard moves right off the ground lead you into a steep rail feature. Tenuous positions through here finish with a dynamic move to a few jugs and a resting zone. Don't let down your guard quite yet... two unique and challenging sections are between you and the chains.# Location
The rightmost route on the left side of the swamp cave. Often has fixed draws.# Protection
