# Description
Another great route. A perfect big brother to Tangled Up in Blue. The first four bolts are powerful, slippery and engaging. From here, the rock changes dramatically and the climbing eases off a little. Share the large hole rest with Tangled, and then carry on into hardening terrain. A thin crux is just a few bolts below the chains.# Location
To the right of Brown Sugar, to the left of Tangled up in Blue.# Protection
