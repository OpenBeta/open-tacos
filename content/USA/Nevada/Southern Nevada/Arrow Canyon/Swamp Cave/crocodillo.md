# Description
This is the second most leftward route on the wall.  There is a variation that goes straight up, but you will want to follow the right leaning series of features.  A good mix of pockets, pinches and jugs this steep line is one of the best 11 sport routes I have done.# Location
Second from the left, make sure you go right, and not up where there is a variation# Protection
Bolts, not sure how many +/- 9 and anchors
