# Description
Chossy climbing over low angle terrain to the high first bolt.  From here, the climbing continues to improve to really nice stone on some steeper gray rock at the top.   The crux is the upper steep part.   Flows perfectly if you start the sequence up high correctly.# Location
2 routes to the right of Simple Twist of Fate, just right of Sherpa James, climbing the same ledgeyÂ start. Look for the sheep skull at the base at about head height.# Protection
bolts, shuts.
