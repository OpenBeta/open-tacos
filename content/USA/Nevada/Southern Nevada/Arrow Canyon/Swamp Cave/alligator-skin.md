# Description
This route makes a nice warm up from some of the other 11's in this area.   It's fairly low angle with a few block bulges.  The holds on this route and it's neighbors to the right tend to be a bit sharper than the others here at the Swamp Cave.# Location
Up canyon from the Swamp Cave Proper.  This is the first route on the left after about a 20 yard gap between the lines.# Protection
bolts, shuts
