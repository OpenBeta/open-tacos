# Description
The rig that conquers the center of the Swamp Cave cleaned up really nice, and offers a cool variety of holds and movement. Begin with a few bolts of easier climbing, then plant a right knee-bar for the routes main rest at about 1/3 height. Fire into a very continuous power endurance boulder problem that ends with the route's crux. Finish on the easier upper headwall.4 stars for movement, 1.5 stars for rock quality (mostly in the easier sections though). However, definitely worth doing!!# Location
The only route out the super steep center of the Swamp Cave.# Protection
