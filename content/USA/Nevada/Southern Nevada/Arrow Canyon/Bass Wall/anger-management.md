# Description
Thin boulder problem gains an immediate rest.  From here, a fun, gymnastic traverse out left and back up and right gains big holds.  Big moves on big holds with the occasional smaller hold takes you to a top out on a short, thin slab.Great rock throughout, but the feet around bolts 3-5 are still cleaning up a bit.# Location
