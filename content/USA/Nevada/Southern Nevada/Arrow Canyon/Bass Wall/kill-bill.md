# Description
A fun, easy corner on less than stellar rock takes you to a no hands rest.  Steep, tricky moves take you to powerful, steep crimping moving out right to a stance.  A few more thin moves lead to the short headwall and chains.A good power route that is on you the whole time after the initial easy corner.# Location
Right of Anger Management.  Look for the corner in tan colored rock.# Protection
