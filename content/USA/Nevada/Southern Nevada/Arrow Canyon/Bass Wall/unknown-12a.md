# Description
A steep, 3-bolt boulder problem on pinches and sidepulls with feet so slick it'll make Rifle feel like gritty granite.  Sound fun?  Yea!  Power through this section to gain a stance and then power up the slightly overhung wall on fantastic, textured, blocky rock.  Several mini cruxes throughout, though none as hard as the first, and several active rests.  Fantastic route!# Location
