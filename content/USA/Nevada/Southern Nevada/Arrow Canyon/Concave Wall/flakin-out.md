# Description
Starting at the right side of the cave and climbs the flake up and clipping glue-ins to the overhanging finish. Very fun climbing on technical feet and juggy holds.# Location
#4 in the Limestone Bible....Right most route inside the cave starting at the obvious flake. There is a bolted line to the right of this outside the cave though.# Protection
4 bolts ( glue ins) -- 2 fixed biners for lower off ease.
