# Description
Ground is worn away leading to a lower vertical start which gets a bit bouldery to the first clip.... Cruxing between 1st and 2nd clip and leading to fun climbing above with a unnecessary but fun knee jam rest before clipping the shared anchors with the 12 c next door to the right.# Location
#1 in Murphys Limestone Bible ...Left most route on the left cave edge. Depending on ground heights due to flooding the first clip may be a bit high.# Protection
4 bolts to shared anchors ( 2015, biners on chains)
