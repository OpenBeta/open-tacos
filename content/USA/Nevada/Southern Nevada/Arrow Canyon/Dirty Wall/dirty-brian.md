# Description
Third route from the Right when looking at the Dirty Wall. Recommended to stick clip the first bolt.Negotiate some steep moves in slippery choss at the start making way quickly to bullet stone by the second clip.  Techy face climbing leads up to a bulge with a reachy move or 2. Then about 40-50 ft of 5.10 on blue rock to the chains. Excellent and varied. Fun!# Location
