# Description
P1 is slab climbing with a distinct well protected crux above the dark overlap.  p2 more slab which crosses a dark band of plates. p3 passes a small roof and a steeper well protected crux in a water course.  Above is a brief fracture system and then more slab to the anchors. Very fun climbing.# Location
# Protection
p1 is 14 bolts and is 37 meters. the other pitches are shorter and have less bolts. All pitches have chain anchors. you need a 70 meter rope.
