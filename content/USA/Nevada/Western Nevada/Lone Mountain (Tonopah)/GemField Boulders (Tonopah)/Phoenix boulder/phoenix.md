# Description
Awesome little balance boulder with some fun moves on it. Start with hands in slots of the crack Work your way up the crack right to large dish/ledge, then make a move up and left, mantel to large dish ledge and top out up left. The small boulder that the large boulder balances on to the left of the start is off. Finding the starting foot beta is a bit tricky but when you do it's a great problem.# Location
