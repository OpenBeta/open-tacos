# Description
This is an alternate to Binky's Revenge. Follows up same beginning but then moves left out under roof and follows crack all the way up to similar finish as Binky's Revenge. Slightly more secure feeling with only a small amount of chossy face climbing at the very top. Okay if you've climbed most of the other stuff at the crag.# Location
Starts in corner a few feet right of Eagle Nest Direct. Beginning is the same as Binky's Revenge, but then moves left out under roof.# Protection
Gear, walk off
