# Description
This is at S1 on the aerial photo. We went pretty much went straight up the slab at the bottom (we placed two bolts), then into a thin crack which became harder (crux is 20 feet up the crack), then easier higher up.There was an old anchor on top, likely for the large chimney / crack to the right of our route. I put in a new two bolt ringed anchor at the top of this route.We didn't walk off, but this is such a large bulky formation that it seems possible. So also possible to scramble up and use top anchors for a top rope for this and the much harder roof climb to the left.# Location
Steep east face of large spire. Â From Elephant Head arch, head uphill and pass one big bulky broken-up spire then you'll see this one.GPS 40.575 -119.992# Protection
