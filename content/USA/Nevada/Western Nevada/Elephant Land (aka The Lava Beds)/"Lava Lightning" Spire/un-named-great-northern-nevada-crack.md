# Description
We didn't do this climb when we first visited but we did spot a sling 3/4 of the way up.Five years later in 2020 we did climb it, and it was easier than it looked. There are modern bolts at a belay station 75 feet up and another at the top. Although easily done in one pitch with a 60m or 70m rope.# Location
Spire 2 spires south of large "Sky Spire".Â  Sky Spire is at GPS 40.575 -118.992. There is a dirt bike track just east of the spire and if you take that south you will soon be in view of this spire.# Protection
