# Description
This is the southeast ridge of the South tower of twin towers (S2 in aerial photo).  There are places for natural pro but you have to seek them out. The rock is rough and a little crumbly in spots on this spire.Probably a 60M rope could do this in one pitch but we did one comfortable pitch and then a short pitch to the top.# Location

We placed two anchor bolts on top for rappel.
