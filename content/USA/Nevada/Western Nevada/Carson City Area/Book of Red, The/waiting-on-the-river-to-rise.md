# Description
The anchors at the top of this wall have been in for many years(placed by Dan Osman? Ron Anderson?) Although the face has never been bolted or cleaned. The route offers a variety of holds and movement that make it sustained and a total blast to climb. Stick clip is recommended for the perma draw in the cave. Enjoy!# Location
This route is on the cone shaped formation you see when approaching from the trail. Start in the chard fire pit streak in the cave with the obvious jugs. Make your way following the bolt line which trends left.# Protection
6 bolts. 1st is a permanent chain draw. Mussy hook anchor.
