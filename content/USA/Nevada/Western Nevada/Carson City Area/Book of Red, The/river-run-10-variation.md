# Description
Use first three bolts of River Run. Move right and fallow two bolts. Do not use the first bolt going to the right. I have been told not to trust it. It has been fallen on to many times. But, you don't need it because you protected the crux by clipping the third bolt on River Run. Use same anchors as River Run and Skull & Crossbones.# Location
Farthest route to the right. Start on River Run, veer right, and finish on the same anchors as River Run and Skull & Crossbones.# Protection
Bolts.DO NOT USE  first bolt on the Variation. It may not be safe to fall on.
