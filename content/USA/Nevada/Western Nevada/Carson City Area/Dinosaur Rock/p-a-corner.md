# Description
Really good stemming and hand jams. At about the 3/4 mark, start traversing right. New anchors in the middle of the face remove any concerns about bad protection.# Location
There are basically two primary dihedrials right next to each other.  This is the one on the left.  Climb directly in the corner.  Use the chains of Big Bang.# Protection
Trad (pro to 1"). 2 bolt anchors in the middle of the face
