# Description
Use the crack for pro for first thirty feet. Head towards the bolts on center of face. Balancing moves on small potato chip thin crimps make this a solid 5.10 a face climb. Using the arete as it is a 5.7 variation for when you find the face climbing is just too committing for you.# Location
To the Right of the Gash.  Start on the right arete and eventually end up on the face.# Protection
pro to 1" plus 3 bolts and draws for the top.
