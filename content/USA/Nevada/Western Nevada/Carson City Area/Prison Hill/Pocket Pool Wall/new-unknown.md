# Description
Crux is a few crimpy moves to get to the single bolt anchor, but otherwise it's a fun route that makes the hike up to this wall even more worth it. I'm simply a climber who noticed the route, would love to know who set it.# Location
This route is to the right of "Scratch". Look for the new bolts leading up to the bolt anchor for "Scratch".# Protection
3 bolts, single top anchor bolt
