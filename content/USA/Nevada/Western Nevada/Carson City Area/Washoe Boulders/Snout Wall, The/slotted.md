# Description
SDS with both hands in the obvious slots, move up into a third slot higher on the face, and then to good holds at the top. Short, but fine as a warmup. I cleaned lichen off the holds I used, but there’s still a lot on the rock.# Location
If you’re standing in front of the “snout”, this problem is to your left, near the left arête of the boulder.# Protection
