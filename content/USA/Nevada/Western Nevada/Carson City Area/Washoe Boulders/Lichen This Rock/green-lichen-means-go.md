# Description
Stay on the green lichen found left of the thin vertical crack. Make your way up easy slab with huecos to the overhanging pocketed bulge feature. Do not fear the lichen, do not veer left or right, head straight up the overhanging pocketed bulge(this is the crux). There are holds to accomplish this I swear. The face above the overhanging bulge is covered in green lichen, but the good holds have been cleaned off/or are obvious. The last mini crux is a mantle move to finish out and reach the anchors.# Location
On the northwest side of the wall, left of "Orange You Lichen This Route?". Stay on the green lichen found to the left of the thin vertical crack, head straight up the overhanging pocketed bulge without using the crack to the right or the green lichen face to the left.# Protection
