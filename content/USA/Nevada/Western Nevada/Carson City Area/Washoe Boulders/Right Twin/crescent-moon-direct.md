# Description
Start just to the right of Maggot Brain. Instead of following pockets to the left, go straight up. Reachy and high at the top.# Location
Basically, there is a whole jumbo of variations on the west side of the north face. Typically, it will be around v2 but the hardest move you might encounter is v3.  Just go for the top.# Protection
