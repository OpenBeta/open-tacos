# Description
A finger heavy traverse line on the main face of Boulder A.  Start on the chalked up jugs to the right and move left staying low using the slopey 2-3 finger holds and small crimps.  You can use the deep pocket toward the end of the line.A good problem to work when you are solo as you will never fall more than a couple inches.Unknown who/when the FA was, if the route has a different name I'd be happy to change it.# Location
The northern facing side of Boulder A.# Protection
