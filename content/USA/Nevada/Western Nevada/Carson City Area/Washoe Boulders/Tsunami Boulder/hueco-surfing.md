# Description
A vertical face with well chalked, small huecos leading to the top. The crux is getting from the 3rd small chalked up hueco to the fourth large chalked up hueco, almost a dyno.# Location
On the Southern side of the Tsunami Boulder, you'll find a vertical face with well chalked small huecos. Basically on the exact opposite side from where the classic overhanging routes are found.# Protection
