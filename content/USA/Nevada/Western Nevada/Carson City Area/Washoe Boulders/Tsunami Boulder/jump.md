# Description
There are a number of varation to the Jump route.  The stand start seems to be the most estetic.  Stand with you left in a two finger pocket (sharp) and your right on a crimp, immidatly pop to the larger crimp hold with your right.  Then move both hands to the double crimp in the middle of the rock. From here there is two options: 1. dyno strait to the top (v6) 2. Make one more left hand move to the sloper left, then move your feet up (high step into the orginal two finger pocket) and reach / pop for the lip (v4ish.)The sit start is rated v5 and goes just the left of the stand start.# Location
Between the decent of Tsunami wall and Silver Surfer.  It is the short bulge in the wall.# Protection
