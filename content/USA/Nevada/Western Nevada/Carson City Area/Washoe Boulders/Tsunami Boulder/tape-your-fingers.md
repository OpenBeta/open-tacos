# Description
Tape your fingers starts just to the right of V6 crack on Tsunami wall, essentially it is the direct start to Escape to Alcatraz.  Begin with your right on the down facing crimp right above the bird poo ledge and your left on the right facing crimp just above the aforementioned crimp.  Move to a crimpy side pull with your right, and then move your left to the crimp just beneath the lip (use the sharp crystal as a thumb catch.)  From this extended crimp position move your feet up, set, and throw for the lip of the large bulge (fun dyno.) If you are still holding on move over the bulge up and right (similar to escape)# Location
Tsunami wall, directly beneath Escape from Alcatraz.# Protection
