# Description
Similar in style to 'The Face,' 'The Face, Right' is the right most line on the large vertical face.  Again crimps and small shallow pocket are the norm.  It is a bit easier that 'The Face,' feels less high ball, and there is the decent to Tsunami Wall to escape to if you fell sketch on the route.  Fun but less quality and less aesthetic that 'The Face.'# Location
To the immediate left of the descent of Tsunami Wall.  It is the right most route on the Vertical face, and parallels the descent of Tsunami Wall.# Protection
