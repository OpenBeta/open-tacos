# Description
WARNING: This route is just long enough to lower your partner with a 60 meter rope. Mind your positioning as belayer (stand close to the wall) and TIE A STOPPER KNOT to avoid the end of the rope slipping through the belay device and dropping your partner as they lower near the bottom.The rock here is mostly good, but are a few loose blocks; test holds before trusting them and yell "ROCK" "like someone's gonna die" if anything comes down. Even quarter size rocks seem like they've come out of a slingshot when they fall off Village Wall because of its length and angle.Start by straddling a small cave, heading straight up and keeping on the steepest path over a few small bulges and ledges. The route continues to steepen where there is lighter colored rock. After a large bench, follow bolt line for ~5.8. Routes eases up at least a grade by going right or left. Keep left after the last bolt to avoid loose rock. The final few moves are the most fun.# Location
There are three routes on the immediately accessible section of Village Wall. This is the route on the climber's Right.# Protection
8 bolts. Mussy hooks at anchor.
