# Description
This is the hardest rated route at Castle Rock. Luckily, being one of the three routes at the Upper Chambers, it shares anchors with the two climbs on either side of it (Dragon's Tail 10b and Dragon's Lair 10c L to R). Lead it like a true "dragon slayer," or climb an adjacent route to set up a toprope and work through the moves.Dragon Slayer heads straight up the face with 11b moves until the 11d crux at the 5th bolt. The route veers Right to the 6th bolt, then shares the final bolt with the route to its Left (Dragon's Tail 10b). Finish at open cold shuts for the anchor. Lower off.# Location
All the routes at Upper Chambers share a set of open cold shuts. Dragon Slayer is the middle of these routes and starts barely Left of the anchors. It is slightly a few feet Right of Dragon's Tail 10b, which is directly beneath the lower end of a diagonal groove.# Protection
7 bolts to open cold shuts at the anchor.
