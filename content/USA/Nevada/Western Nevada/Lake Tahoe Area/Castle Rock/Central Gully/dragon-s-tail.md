# Description
This is the far Left route at Upper Chambers. It starts straight up a run out face then follows under a diagonal groove in the rock veering Right to open cold shuts. Vertical face climbing. Possibly a bit sandbagged. Lower off.Note that the R rating is arguable and should be taken with a grain of salt. The moves to the high-placed first bolt and the clipping stance are not particularly difficult for the route's 10b rating. It seems unlikely that a fall should occur, but climbers should attempt the route with forethought as a fall could result in injury. The R rating primarily serves as a heads up for climbers who are scanning the area for 5.10's which are limited in the Castle Rock area. The safety rating also takes into consideration MP's definition of R as "a fall could be dangerous," which could be accurate. MP's definition of PG13 as "slightly run out," could also be fitting.Take the R rating and helpful user comments into consideration while looking for climbs to enjoy. Have fun, be safe, and climb on.# Location
