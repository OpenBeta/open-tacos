# Description
This is the far Left route at the Lower Chambers. The climb travels diagonally to the Right until finally traversing to open cold shuts at the anchor. Some bolts have a little more distance between them but the falls here are much safer than juggier or low angle routes--Lower Chambers is totally vertical with some cool edges and ledges.# Location
Lower Chambers is found on the Right side of the Central Gully as you near the bottom. It is comprised of two routes sharing a set of open cold shuts. Pendulum is the Left of these options.# Protection
6 bolts and open cold shuts at the anchor.
