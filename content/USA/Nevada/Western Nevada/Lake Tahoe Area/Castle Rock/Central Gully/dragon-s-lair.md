# Description
Far Right route at the Upper Chambers. Starts behind a tree from the dirt and leads up to a terrace, then continues up the face veering Left to open cold shuts at the anchor. For an 11a variation, go Left and finish theDragonSlayerbolt line (see route beta) after clipping the third bolt forDragon'sLair(technically you earn some dragon slayer status by doing this, but only for a little dragon). Lower off.# Location
All the routes at Upper Chambers share a set of open cold shuts. Dragon's Lair is the far Right route and starts behind a tree from the dirt with its first bolt just below a terrace. This route veers Left to finish at open cold shuts.# Protection
5 bolts (also 5 if climbing variation) to open cold shuts at anchor.
