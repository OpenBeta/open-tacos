# Description
Dragon's Lair is the far Right route at the Upper Chambers. The standard route starts behind a tree from the dirt and leads up to a terrace, then continues up the face veering Left to open cold shuts at the anchor. For the 11a variation (rather than the standard 10c) go Left after clipping the 3rd bolt and finish on the last two bolts on Dragon Slayer (technically you earn some dragon slayer status by doing this, but only for a little dragon). Keep in mind the final bolt is also shared with the far Left route (Dragon's Tail 10b). Lower off.# Location
All the routes at Upper Chambers share a set of open cold shuts. Dragon's Lair is the far Right route and starts behind a tree from the dirt with its first bolt just below a terrace.# Protection
5 bolts to open cold shuts at the anchor.
