# Description
This is the Right side option at the Lower Chambers. The climb travels diagonally to the Right until the final bolt directly beneath open cold shuts at the anchor. Run out start. Start on higher ground and clip the 2nd bolt as your first for a variation. Some bolts have a little more distance between them but the falls here are much safer than juggier or low angle routes--Lower Chambers is totally vertical with some cool edges and ledges.# Location
Lower Chambers is found on the Right side of the Central Gully just before you reach the bottom. It appears after passing a run out climb that starts above a ledge (The Holy Flail 5.11b). It is comprised of two routes that climb diagonally Right to a set of open cold shuts. Pendulum is the Right of these options and its variation begins on higher ground using the 2nd bolt as its 1st.# Protection
6 bolts to open cold shuts at the anchor.
