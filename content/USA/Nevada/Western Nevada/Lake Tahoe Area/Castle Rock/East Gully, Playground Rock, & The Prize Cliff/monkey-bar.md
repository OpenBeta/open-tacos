# Description
Starts vertical following a diagonal crack. Crux between the 2nd and 3rd bolt. Transition to low angle section that becomes progressively steeper. Holds are sparse only for a moment and then get deeper and juggier as you near mussy hooks at the anchor. Lower off.WATCH OUT: If you're setting up a toprope, set up a directional at the 3rd bolt, otherwise the toprope climber could swing off the side of the buttress and crash into the ground.When lowering off, keep Left to avoid swinging off and decking.# Location

9 bolts. Mussy hooks at anchor.
