# Description
Steep start at the arete comes up to a platform then low angle climbing. Just a few 5.7 or 5.8 moves at the start and another cruxy spot between the 4th and 5th bolt. Run up the rest! Finish at mussy hooks for anchor. Lower off.WATCH OUT: If you're setting up a toprope, set up a directional at the 4th bolt, otherwise the toprope climber could swing off the side of the buttress and crash into rocks or even deck.When lowering off, keep right to avoid swinging off and decking.# Location
