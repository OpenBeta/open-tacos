# Description
WATCH OUT: Be mindful of potential rock fall if a climber chooses to go off route, deviating from the bolt line. Climbers, yell "ROCK!!" for the safety of those below in the event ofanyrock fall.Plenty of distinct holds, some variety in terrain. Keep left near top to finish at appropriate anchors (mussy hooks, NOT chains). Moves become thinner between last several bolts for an interesting crux (perhaps > 5.6?). Well protected. Lower off.# Location
Far Left route on Armory Wall. Just Left of tree.# Protection
Well protected. 12 bolts. Mussy hooks at the anchor. Farthest left anchor on wall; not to be confused with route at climber's right (In Depends Pants Day 5.6, 2 pitch)
