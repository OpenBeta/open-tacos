# Description
Adventurous route moving through a variety of features--from a juggy start into a giant low angle terraced dihedral, and over some bulges. Some mantles, stemming, and fun movement up to a slick cruxy finish with some helpful incut holds under a ginormous roof. The rock itself is impressive, and the view at Armory Wall is exceptional as well. Lower off.# Location
Far Right on "the platform" at the West side of Armory Wall.# Protection
13 bolts. Mussy hooks at the anchor.
