# Description
This is a great, crimpy, thinkpiece!  Avoiding the big flake to the left makes this route an 11a. The beginning is easier up to the last couple of bolts.  Find the little crystal hold with your left hand, get your feet high and crank your ass off to the top.# Location
On the South Face just left of Maxwell's Hammer (5.8+). This is the first route to the right of the prominent crack on the main south face.  Just in front of the big tree.# Protection
A very well bolted route. Bring 8 draws, including those you will need to clip the top bolts. The crux is towards the top and is well bolted.
