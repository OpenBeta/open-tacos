# Description
This is the route on the west face that has a rock stack below it. Start with your hands or hand in the pocket. I used the rock stack to make the first move. This is the crux. The rest of the climb is pretty moderate. I do not know if the .11b rating is with or without the rock stack. With the rock stack it is still one hell of a move. Beware of sharp rock. I got a huge flapper from the first move. The rock was sharp enough I didn't ever feel it happen.# Location
West side of Spooner Crag, next route to the right of Pot Belly.# Protection
Three bolts and anchors. I stick clipped the first bolt.
