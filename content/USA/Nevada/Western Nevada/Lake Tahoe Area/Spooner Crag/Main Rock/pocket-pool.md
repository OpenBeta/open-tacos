# Description
This is a pocked short route.  It is a bit overhung and pretty pumpy.  There is a rest with a possible knee bar half way threw but otherwise the route is pretty sustained.# Location
Southwest Face of Spooner Crag. The route is on the shorter slice of rock which is left of the more prominent piece of crag.  The two rocks are split by a significant crack.  You follow the right-most bolts.# Protection
Can be done as a sport lead or a top rope.  You can access the top anchors by rappelling 15 or so feet from the top of the slabby moderates around the corner to the right.  There are sealed hooks at the top and they are pretty new. Very safe protection.
