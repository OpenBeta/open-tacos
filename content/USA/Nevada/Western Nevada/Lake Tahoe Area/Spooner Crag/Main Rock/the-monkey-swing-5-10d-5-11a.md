# Description
Start on sloping ground right of the first bolt. Pull up and then do a strenous lieback with your right hand while your left makes a BIG reach for a pocket (this move is much more difficult if you are under 5'10''). Continue traversing up and left on pockets. After the second bolt, the difficulties ease. Catch your breath and head to the top.The direct start looks like hard 5.12.# Location
The line just left of Nightcap's first pitch.# Protection
4 bolts to a two bolt anchor with rappel chains. The first bolt protects the traverse in, but is a strenous clip. The fourth bolt and anchor are shared by Nightcap.
