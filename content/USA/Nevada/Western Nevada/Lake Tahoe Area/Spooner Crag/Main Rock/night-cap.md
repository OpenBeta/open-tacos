# Description
This route is pretty straight forward.  Follow the bolts just left of the large crack on the south face of Spooner Crag. There are 4 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor.  You can stop there or proceed over the top to a brand spanking new set of stainless hangers to the first belay.  From this belay follow the bolts to the summit over a small 12-18 inch overhang.  You will find a nasty old rusty piece of crap metal chunk and a nice new bolt to absail from. Throw your rope over the back side of the climb (the side that you did not climb up).  You are able to reach the bottom over the back with a 60 meter rope.# Location
