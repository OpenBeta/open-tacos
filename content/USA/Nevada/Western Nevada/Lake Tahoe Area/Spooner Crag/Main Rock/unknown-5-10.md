# Description
Same general start as 'Forget About It.'  Goes left up the ramp.  A bit contrived for first few bolts.  Third bolt route goes vertical.  Crux section bolts 3/4.  5-6 total bolts. Same anchors as 'Forget About It.'  Still a bit dirty.# Location
Starts at the same spot as 'Forget About It.'  Can skip first two bolts by starting up the chimney and then going straight up at third bolt.# Protection
5-6 bolts. Chains. Hooks.
