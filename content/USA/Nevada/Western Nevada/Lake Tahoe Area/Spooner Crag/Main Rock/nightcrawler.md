# Description
Near the easily identified Pocket Pool, Nightcrawler is the left most of three intersecting bolt lines.Battling a barn door situation while hanging on to a half pad pocket, making big moves between vertical slots, then juggling assorted incuts and edges along with the occasional jug to eventually meet up the Pocket Pool finish, you will probably have your hands full on this sustained route. This route is sequential and fun to puzzle through, so it is worth the effort. I have stuck with the book rating, although the true grade may be a biiiit higher than indicated.# Location
On the SW face of Spooner Crag on the separated pinnacle that forms a chasm between the routes Pocket Pool and Jello Wars.# Protection
4 bolts, to 2 bolt anchor
