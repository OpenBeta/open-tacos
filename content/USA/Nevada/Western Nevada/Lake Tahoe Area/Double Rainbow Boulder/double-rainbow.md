# Description
You wont find a boulder problem like this anywhere in Tahoe.  The 45 degree overhung face is dotted with just enough pockets to make the ascent.  This line lends itself to the gym climber, as all of the holds are bomber, but the moves linking them tend to be very dynamic.# Location
This boulder problem is not at Spooner Crag.  This overhung boulder face is located on the side of Hwy. 28 about a mile from the junction of Hwy. 28 and Hwy.50.  Look for the streaked overhung face up on a ledge about 30 ft. off the road.# Protection
Bring multiple pads if possible.  The line trends directly over a chasm formed by the split boulder warranting the "pg. 13" rating.
