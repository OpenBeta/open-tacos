# Description
Place your pad beneath the tree on the "Daggett" side of the boulder. Start with a left hand on the lower edge of a slopey rail, and a right hand in a side-pull pocket on the leftmost side of the boulder. Proceed with a right hand to an upper rail and pull to a good crimp on the left side. Get feet up and use a dope undercling to traverse to good crimps at the top. PLEASE DO NOT TOP OUT as the dismount is sketch.# Location
Behind the branches of a small pine tree.# Protection
