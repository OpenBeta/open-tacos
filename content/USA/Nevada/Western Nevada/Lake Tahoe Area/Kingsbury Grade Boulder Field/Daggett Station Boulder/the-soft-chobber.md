# Description
A confidence builder and great warm up to the nearby "The Big Chob Prevails."  Start with your hands in the shoulder-level crack and with your feet comfortably placed on the lowest crack.  Bump your left hand up before you move your feet up to match your right hand.  Use the crack to move the hands up before traversing to the left with your feet along a prominent rail.  The top out is easy and now you're warmed up.# Location
Shorter than a 5 minute walk South of the "The Big Chob Prevails" and behind some smaller boulders higher up the hill.# Protection
