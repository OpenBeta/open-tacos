A bouldery, dynamic start leads to a fun crack seam. The climb stays sustained throughout and exits to the anchors via a crimp/jug sequence. Very good, pumpy sport climbing, emphasizing crimps like the other routes. What's that smell?# Location
Immediately to the right of Leisure Suit.# Protection
5 bolts to two bolt anchor with chains.
