# Description
A series of 3 cracks. Same start as Tweedle Dee, but instead of following the left leaning crack all the way up, climb right to the middle crack about 10 ft up, and right again to the last crack below the hangers. Great for kids and beginners.# Location
Same starting point as Tweedle Dee, at the base of the obvious, left leaning crack on the very far left of Trippy Rock.# Protection
Use the same bolted anchor as Tweedle Dee for top roping.If leading, need gear from .75" to 3" for the route. Hangers at the top to anchor from, or top out and walk off.
