# Description
The first few moves feel more like a 5.7 route, but this route gets easier after the first 15 feet. Nice addition to the easy side of Trippy Rock. Also, not sure who set the anchors here, but this route can be found in new Supertopo guides for North Lake Tahoe.# Location
The start is just next door to tweedle dee and doo. About 5 feet right and down hill. It's purely top rope, and the anchors are on top of an arete that's found just one ledge down and to the west of the tweedle anchors. These anchors are hard to miss when you're on top of Trippy Rock, but impossible to see from the ground.# Protection
