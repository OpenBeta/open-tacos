# Description
The hardest route viable on the butterscotch slab. The original finder of this boulder is seen climbing this route in the photo. Be prepared to be defeated :PFeatures crimps on a much more vertical section of the slab, good footwork is rewarded.# Location
About as far left as you can go on the butterscotch slab, look for tiny chalked up crimps.# Protection
