# Description
SDS or you probably won't get it. Heavily chalked up right side pull and left sloper. Make your way up left toward the pockets and cracks. Slim and curved feet. Hang your body left away from the slim side pull and make use of the left arete until you can top out over the corner.Grasping those cracks, pockets and side pulls is the crux. Once you get that, you're gold.Put it at a 2+, but open to additional opinions for a firm rating. It's easier than the V3 but only a little.Two spotters recommended because you could fall sideways in either direction with serious risk of hitting your head on the rock right behind you (regular pad wouldn't even fit long ways, had to fold it in half against that rock)# Location
Furthest left position of the rock, further than all the photos here. Makes use of the left arete. Start between the boulder and the rock right behind you.# Protection
Pad, protect against the rock behind you
