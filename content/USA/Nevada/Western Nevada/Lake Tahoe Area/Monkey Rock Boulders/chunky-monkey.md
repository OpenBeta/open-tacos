# Description
Start low at some edges on the left side. Go up a little with your right hand then up further with your left to a small lip. Then lunge around the arete of the boulder to a large hueco. From there either top out or go out to the left to nice holds and top out there.# Location
When at Monkey Rock and facing the lake, turn left and you will see the large boulder with a large hueco on it up the hill maybe 10 yards away.# Protection
