# Description
A very fun and worthwhile route in a beautiful setting. From Hinkey Summit (The Pass), this is the closest most prominent chunk of rock. The West Face is quite steep and you can't miss the obvious very prominent exciting looming arch on its (left) northern side.At a high point at the base of the crag far below and to the right of the hole of the rock arch, look for a few bolts traversing right and up the slab.At the lowest and longest point of the formation, we encountered and climbed another unknown multi pitch route which seemed meandering in nature and more run out and difficult.Pitch #1: Climb the very easy approach pitch up and right to a two-bolt belay. 3 bolts, 15m, 5.3.Pitch #2: Follow the steepening bolt line up and right. Pass a small overhang and continue trending right to a nice stance and two-bolt belay. 12 bolts, 35m, 5.6.Pitch #3: Continue following the best rock quality more or less straight up to the top of the crag and a two-bolt belay. 10 bolts, 35m, 5.6.Though the route is equipped for rappel, the walk off is the most logical and easiest descent.Despite cleaning and brushing, Helmets are highly recommended for added safety.All bolts are Stainless Steel and most are glue ins for longevity.# Location
In Winnemucca, drive North out of town on Malarkey Avenue and follow signs about 40 miles into the Paradise Valley and Hinkey Summit. After passing a landmark named Solid Silver and the town of Paradise in the Paradise Valley, drive up the Hinkey Summit (7850 feet) switchbacks on a good unimproved road. The formation dubbed "The Hinkey Hop" is a short skip and a hop from the Pass. You will see a delapitated abandoned 4H Clubhouse and a useable Outhouse in pretty rough condition.Great camping at the Lye Creek campground a few miles down the other side of Hinkey Summit.Please bring your own firewood and keep this pristine place clean.# Protection
13-14 QDs. Some cam placements are also possible but it is well protected with glue in bolts.
