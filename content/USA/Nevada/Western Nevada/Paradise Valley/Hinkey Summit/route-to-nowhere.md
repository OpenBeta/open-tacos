# Description
This route has been around for years and it's unknown who put it up. It's the furthest bolted route to the right at the crag and leads up to and past the big shallow cave in the middle of the wall. See topo photo located in the photos section. It's safe and fairly clean, but still needs some cleaning (gravel, lichen, etc) to be fully enjoyable. Helmets are highly recommended for this climb and all climbing at Hinkey Summit.P1: High first bolt but easy climbing to get to it. Cool pockets and jugs. 2 bolt/hanger belay station equipped with a quick link and rap ring. 6 bolts 18m 5.8P2 (option 1): Climb up and right towards the right side of the shallow cave. Then follow a short, very closely bolted line coming out of the right side of the cave. The first 3 bolts are 5.7ish, but the 3 bolts coming out of the cave are 5.10-. 2 bolt/hanger anchor station with a quick link and rap ring. 6 bolts 15m 5.10-P2 (option 2): After clipping the second bolt of P2 (option 1), veer left to find a set of anchors at the bottom left side of the cave. The cave is enjoyable to hang out in and makes a nice lunch spot. 2 bolt/hanger anchor station with 2 carabiners for rappelling (please leave the carabiners here or replace with something better). You can also make this into a 3 pitch route by following the directions from P2 (option 1) out of the right side of the cave. 2 bolts 7m 5.7# Location
