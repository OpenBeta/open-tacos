# Description
Fun and varied climbing on decent rock. Lots of trundling and cleaning has led to a pretty good route that will continue to improve with more ascents. Expect runouts on easy terrain and a more alpine feel to the bolt spacing in general. Two distinct cruxes add some spice to the climbing.P1: Start up through rotten looking rock on lots of positive holds, skirting a small overhang.7 bolts 27m 5.9P2: Follow bolts up over bulges to the first crux on a vertical face, sequential moves on pockets and edges.8 bolts 27m 5.10+P3: Climb up the right side of the bolt line to avoid rotten rock, up to a fun water streak with hard patina edges. Step right to the belay.7 bolts 27m 5.8P4: Up through more nice edges and pockets to a groove, more sequence climbing through pockets and stemming, the final crux takes you to the top of the feature for a stunning view across the neighboring valley.6 bolts 27m 5.10+Double bolt belay/rappel stations, the route can be rapped with a 60m rope. All hardware is 3/8 x 3.5" Power-Bolt+ and Fixe hangers.# Location
