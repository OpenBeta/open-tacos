# Description
On the tallest pillar with a 1' wide block at the top is a sport climb with six bolts visible. The first bolt is 14' off the ground and just below a large ledge and be reached by two finger cracks on the right or a boulder on the left and clipping below you from the ledge (easy to lay down). The next bolt is clippable by standing on that ledge. Steep crimpy face climbing or crack climbing off the ledge leads to third bolt before the climbing gets slabby past another bolt. The fourth bolt is a tough crux. The rest of the bolts curve up and over to the left toward chain and clip bolts at the top.# Location
Tallest tower on far right.# Protection
