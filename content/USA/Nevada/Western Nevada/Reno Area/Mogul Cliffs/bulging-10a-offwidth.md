# Description
Above the tallest tower on the right is a 40" tall boulder split by two cracks.  The left crack is a 5-6" wide bulging off width.  Start by climbing through easier ground (5.7) over broken rock to the base of the main crack.  Fists, lay backing and strenuous off fists will get you past the buldge.  The crack is filled with debris and bird shit.  Not a terribly pleasant climb but not bad for working off width skills.# Location
Obvious split rock up and right from the tallest tower.# Protection
