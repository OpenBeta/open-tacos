# Description
The nose shaped top rope route looks mostly featureless on right/east/inside but you can boulder up to the tip of the nose and pull yourself out onto the edge. There is a white stained rock (booger?) that indicates a good foot start. There are good foot chips and arete jugs to start. Climb up the nose, some jugs, crimps, high steps, cracks, etc. Classic mix and really fun.# Location
The tallest tower in the center of the cliffs with two anchors (short TR anchor and taller chained anchor) is in the center. This is the shorter tower to the left/west of that right/east of the off width route. The anchors are at the same height as the center tower. In the route map, this is shorter, straight route (previously unlisted). Itâ€™s shaped like a big nose.# Protection
2 eye hole bolts at the top
