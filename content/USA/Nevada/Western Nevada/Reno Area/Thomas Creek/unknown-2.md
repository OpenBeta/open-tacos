# Description
Start at the overhang just below the first bolt, the crux is below the first of 3 bolts and the climbing gets easier the higher you go.  Use a stick clip or be tall to protect the opening hard moves as a fall from just a few feet off the ground could send you down the hill.Somebody marked it in chalk as 11a and that felt about right to me.I tried to toprope this climb before I lead it but all the loose rock at the top made me wish I had just lead it right off the bat.Any extra info on the climb or the crag would be greatly appreciated# Location
First bolts left of the 5.9+.  Scramble over the 4ft tall rock# Protection
3bolts + anchor
