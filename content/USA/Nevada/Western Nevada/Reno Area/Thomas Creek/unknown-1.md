# Description
Big chunks of rock down low look bad but feel good, follow the three bolts up the short but sweet overhanging rock.  As the angle eases up the crux starts.  Feels a little stiff to me but it probably fits in well with the rest of the area.This might be the only climb here that a toprope is a real option, if you scramble up the gully and head left the bolts can easily be reached.  BE CAREFUL with the loose rock and dirt in the gully and extend your anchor past the sharp ledgeComment if you know the name# Location
In the main area on the left.  Look for a ledge to sit/start on with a bolt nearby.  There as of 2020 there is 10b written in chalk at the start.# Protection
3 bolts + top anchor, walk off (carefully)
