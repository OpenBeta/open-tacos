# Description
This route is kinda weird..  You can either start on the really easy slab at the far right, or just do the bulge/roof start of spit.  I usually opt for the latter, more fun.  Once you get to big platform where you can stand, go on the right route.  From here it might be a rules game.  Really hard if you stay on the face the whole time, or you can mantle onto a rest stance on the arete.  This is just after the 2'nd bolt.  From here, do some cool lieback moves to the top.# Location
This is the farthest route to the right on the main wall.# Protection
