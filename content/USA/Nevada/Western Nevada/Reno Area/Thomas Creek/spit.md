# Description
Lots of fun.  Start in the dihedral and work through a bulge/roof.  After 2'nd bolt, gain the big platform and take a break.  Clip the 3'rd bolt and get ready for continues crimping to the top.  Be careful going from the 4'th to the 5'th bolt.  I have broken holds off before here, can be scary when that happens.  Helmet for the belayer?# Location
