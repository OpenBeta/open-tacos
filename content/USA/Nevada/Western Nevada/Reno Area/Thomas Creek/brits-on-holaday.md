# Description
Fun route.  First bolt is a little ways up there.  The crux is from the 1'st bolt to the 2'nd.  Can be a little wierd.  After that, climb horizontal cracks and pockets to the open hook chains at top.  One time a bat hissed at me when I put my hand in one of the cracks.  He was in there sleeping.# Location
The third route from the right.  Climb on the right face of the arete.# Protection
Bolts (5) extra clip for the top.
