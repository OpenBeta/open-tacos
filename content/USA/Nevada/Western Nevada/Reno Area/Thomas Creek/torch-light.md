# Description
This route is fun! Might be a little harder than 10b.Climb up some easy choss.  Come to a overhanging bulge.  clip the first bolt and start up a thin crack with crimps on the face.  After clipping the 2nd bolt, pull over the bulge.  At the top of the bulge, clip 3'rd. Work up the lichen overgrown slab, run out.  Go over 1' roof.  I have fallen here and it's long.  Next go up to big 3' roof.  Pull through (easier than it looks) clip bolt and climb last easy 10' to the top.  Be carefule around this section though.  Last spring I pulled off a 12" diamater "bomber" hold.  Almost knocked my belayer out.# Location
When you walk up to the main wall, you will see four different bolted routes directly infront of you.  If you walk down to the start of spat, keep walking around the corner.  This route is on the backside of the main wall.  Only line on this wall with bolts.  Watch out for the stinging nettles at the belay area.# Protection
Bolts.  I want to say six maybe seven.  But I can't remember.  Feels run out sometimes.
