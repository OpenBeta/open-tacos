# Description
Starts out with the typical, kind of easy slab for the area. This start is shared with the 5.8 to the right. At the ledge/inflection from slab to overhang, this route drifts to the left using underclings in the heuco system. From the huecos, the route moves through somewhat thin holds to exit the roof and a committing move to a good horn on the right. A fall moving to this horn could land a leader on the ledge below, thus the PG13 rating. Solid holds above the roof lead to the anchors.# Location
Left of center on the East face.# Protection
5-7 bolts and toe hook anchors.
