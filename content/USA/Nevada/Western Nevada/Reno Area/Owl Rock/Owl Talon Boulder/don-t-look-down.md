# Description
Nice solid lava rock holds, fun and easy until you have to get over the roof.  Getting over the roof at the end of this route is the crux.# Location
Just right of the clay stripped center that separates the cave and the tall roof, you'll see a jagged hold that's easy to grab.  Start there and head up towards the overhanging roof.# Protection
