# Description
A compression problem up a distinctive coffin-shaped boulder. Start standing and begin squeezing up the widening block with tricky feet/ body position, to a final big bump to a good hold on the right side of the roof. Catch your breath, throw your heel up, then pull an exciting mantle over the roof to the top. Felt pretty sweet for the zone!# Location
In the cluster at the top of the boulder field, approx 5 min walking uphill then right from Singletrack Crack. If walking down from the top, it should be the first sizable boulder cluster on your left a hundred yards or so from the trail.# Protection
A pad or two.
