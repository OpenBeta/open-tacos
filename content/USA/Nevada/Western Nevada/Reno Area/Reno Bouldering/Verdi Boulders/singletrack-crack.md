# Description
A surprisingly nice line, and a great warmup. Start standing on the fin/arete feature and use laybacks, good feet, and maybe a couple of jams to reach the sloping top. Topping out directly using the crack is more awkward than difficult...but simply stepping right to the obvious foot then topping out makes for a more pleasant problem.# Location
In the cluster of boulders with the large, round, obvious white slab, further up the hill from Beam Me Up.# Protection
A couple of pads.
