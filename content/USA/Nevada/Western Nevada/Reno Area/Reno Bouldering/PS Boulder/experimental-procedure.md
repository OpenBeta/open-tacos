# Description
Another delicate but very cool line goes up at the sandy Primordial Soup/PS Boulder.Moving right to left, decent edges and heel locks lead to a 45 degree jam on questionable stone.  Bring the feet up and reach for the top, but watch the soft stone or find yourself on your back with a hand-full of red dust!# Location
Primordial Soup Boulder below Peavine Mountain# Protection
Several pads would be good
