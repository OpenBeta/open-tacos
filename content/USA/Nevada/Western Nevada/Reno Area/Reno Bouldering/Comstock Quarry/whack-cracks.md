# Description
A harder route that uses only the orange-ish face found right of the V1 Dihedral route. There are three distinct cracks running horizontally accross this face. The trick to this route is that those vertical cracks work better as underclings than crimps.# Location
Found just to the right of V1 Dihedral. Look for three horizontal cracks.# Protection
