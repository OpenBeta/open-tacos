# Description
Fantastic problem on excellent rock. Start with R hand on a sidepull and the left on a horizontal crack. Reach high up to a deep finger jam then again up to a higher jam. Cruise up to a horizontal rail, work the feet up, then go for another few jams and finally left to a juggy edge before hitting the top of the prow where a final airy mantel awaits. Pull over the top right near a bent hangerless bolt.An alternate (and recommended) start begins a bit left on a juggy low rail, goes up with the right to a crimpy thin crack then left higher on the same thin crack and ends on the same horizontal crack as the normal variation before finishing up the same moves to the top of the prow.It is fun to link the arete route into downclimbing the Seamstress and going back up via the alternate and vice versa.The seams further left are even thinner and tricker. Finally, it can be quite fun to traverse the boulder along the horizontal crack. It is slopey with thin feet on the left side, juggy in the middle, and has some fun moves on the right. All kinds of options!# Location
Road Cut Wall. Stay low key and park at the school and walk the greenbelt 5 minutes up to the trail or better yet, ride your bike (bikes arestronglyrecommended for traveling in the entire zone as minimal impact will keep these areas open, not to mention there are awesome paths and views to enjoy).# Protection
Some rocks in the landing so bring a pad or a no-fall rule.
