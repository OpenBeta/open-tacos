# Description
Start on the large jug on the left of the over-hanging rock, make your way right and top out over the left shoulder. Must do if you are on the east ridge of the Sommerset boulders. I recently discovered this boulder is called "White Face", I had previously incorrectly labeled it as "The Nun" and have since changed it. I found the info here:http://www.reno.bookofboulders.com/PumpkinPatch.html# Location
East ridge of Sommerset bouldersSouth of Road Cut boulders. If you access the Road cut boulders from the south via a switch back trail to the ridge to this boulder will be very obvious on the ridge line. This is a residential area so be respectful towards the residents, please!# Protection
