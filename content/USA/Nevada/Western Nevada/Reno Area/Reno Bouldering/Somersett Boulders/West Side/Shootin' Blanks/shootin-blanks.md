# Description
# Location
Located in the Lower west side.Also here you will find another short but awesome smear-fest directly up the face of this boulder, we call this V5+ slab the Poker Face( FA: Sean Carlson) On this line the granite is blank, almost vert, and your moving basically on fingernails or just texture.# Protection
2 pads minimum and a spotter as a fall here could be disasterous.
