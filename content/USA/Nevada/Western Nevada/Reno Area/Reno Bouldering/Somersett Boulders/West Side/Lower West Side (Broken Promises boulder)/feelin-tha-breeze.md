# Description
Start using face holds just to the left of the chimney. Excellent moves along the arete will bring you to a large juggy rail, bump the hands up into a stellar thin finger crack. Traverse the finger crack to the left (keep the feet smeared below the jug rail for more fun/challenge) then mantle over the top. Don't forget to feel tha breeze! This climb is also an awesome descent off the top of the boulder.# Location
South Side of lower West Side Pebble, to the left of the chimney.# Protection
No falling.
