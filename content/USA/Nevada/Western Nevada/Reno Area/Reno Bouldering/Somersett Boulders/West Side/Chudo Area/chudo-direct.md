# Description
A harder direct finish to Chudo. Climb Chudo until the horizontal crimp rail. Make a move left to a small crimp and then go big for the sloper on the lip. A much more committing top out than Chudo. Watch out for the boulder behind you at the crux.# Location
# Protection
A mondo pad and a small pad will work very well to cover the boulder. At the crux throw you can easily step off.
