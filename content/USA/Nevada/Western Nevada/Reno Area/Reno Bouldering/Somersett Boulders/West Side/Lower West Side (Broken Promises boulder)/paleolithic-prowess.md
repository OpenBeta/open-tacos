# Description
To the right of Movin Like Bernie, Feelin The Breeze, etc is a cool looking triangular boulder.  Sit start with hands matched on a good hold and make a cool bump up and right if I recall correctly.  There is another problem that we established, but my memory is hazy as to what it was.FA Story:B. Hatchett and I were out at the Peavine Pebbles wandering about and after doing the previous problem that was a fun finger crack on this on a very detached flake. BH and I both noticed that the flake was flexing in a very dangerous way.  After some caveman work, we cleaned the flake (probably weighed ~50 lbs, enough to cause serious injury if it fell on you) and got the FA of both this and a problem that goes out and left, sharing the start for Paleolithic Prowess.# Location
South of Feelin The Breeze near an impressive saucer roof which likely houses a hard problem or two.Subsequent edit:The aforementioned roof is Chudo and Chudo Direct# Protection
Pad.
