# Description
A cool warm up on tiny edges, this obvious problem unfolds like a half traverse, half climb...starting low and to the right, step on small smears and look for a series of fingernail sized edges working up n left.Though not the hardest problem, if you lose your focus this thing can buck you off as the edges are mostly credit cards or just texture.# Location
West Side.# Protection
Pads.
