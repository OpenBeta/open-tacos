# Description
Start in the beautiful corner on the left side of the main face. Imagine how awesome it would be if the dihedral with hand crack went on for 2000ft.Enjoy a variety of methods of ascent to pull over the first small bulge (you can also traverse right into Broken Promises), then work up the second pedestal corner within a beautiful orange corner with the bird-poo sharp edge and tricky high smear with the foot. Mantle onto the pedestal and once you are standing on it, tilt ya head back like a nose bleed comin thru!Move like Bernie to find the solution to the bulging top out. Several exit strategies exist; all are fun.youtube.com/watch?v=TRBLmogâ€¦# Location
