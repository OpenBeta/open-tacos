# Description
A really unique climb up overhanging crimps. Start low down on the vertical wall and traverse right through tiny crimps to a top out on a positive sloper. A classic for the area!# Location
This is located up and around the corner from Shattered Dreams.# Protection
The landing is unfortunately not the best as there is a giant boulder right below you. People have fallen on this problem several times with no injuries. A mondo and a smaller pad should do pretty well.
