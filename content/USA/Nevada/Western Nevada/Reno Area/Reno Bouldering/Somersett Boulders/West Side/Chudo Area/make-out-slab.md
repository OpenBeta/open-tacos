# Description
This is the obvious slab at the top of the lookout road above the west side cluster.  not much else up here, but this is worth a quik go for those climbing in the V0-3 range.Ultra blank smears and the arete lead to a slap up top, or do it without the arete for added difficulty.There might be another problem on this same boulder.# Location
Head out towards the West Side zone, but take the left turn and follow it as it winds up and around to a lookout.  Boulder is on your left.# Protection
