# Description
start sitting with left hand in hueco, right on tiny crimp pinch. cruise up through powerful moves on small holds to a super slippery, hard top out.  V 4/5 variation is going left and moving onto dihedral. Very quality problem.# Location
This route is maybe 10 feet to the right of the dihedral - obvious hueco sidepull about 6 inches in diameter at about 3 feet off the ground.# Protection
