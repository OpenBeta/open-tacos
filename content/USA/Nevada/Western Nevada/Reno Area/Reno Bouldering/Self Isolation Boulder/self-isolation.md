# Description
Sit start down low almost in a sagebrush bush, with your left hand on a good obvious sidepull and right hand on a think triangle pinch (looks almost like a crimp). Pull hard and do a big move to a very sharp but decent sloper. Move out left to a small but good rail and top out. First move is crux.# Location
This is the only boulder in the area and this problem is on the right hand side of the only climbable face.# Protection
One crash pad is more than enough.
