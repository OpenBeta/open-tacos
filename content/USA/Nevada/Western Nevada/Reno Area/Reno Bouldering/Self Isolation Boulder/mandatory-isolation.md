# Description
Sit start on a crimpy left hand with your right hand on the slopey shelf 3 feet to the right. Pull on with an awkward hell hook and make a powerful move to a thin rail. Make some awkward moves and top out. First move is crux.# Location
This climb is about 4 feet left of Â 'Self-Isolation' V3.# Protection
One pad is more than enough.
