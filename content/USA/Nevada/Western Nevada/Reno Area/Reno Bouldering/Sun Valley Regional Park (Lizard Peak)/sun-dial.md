# Description
Start at the bottom of the big hollow flake (as for Sundry), climb right on the undercling pinch feature, then straight up the clean face. If the entire feature wasn't hollow, the interesting movement on this might net it three stars. The flake seems pretty solid, but who knows..?# Location
Back side of parking lot boulder, straight up the big, clean flake.# Protection
A pad or two, be careful with flake.
