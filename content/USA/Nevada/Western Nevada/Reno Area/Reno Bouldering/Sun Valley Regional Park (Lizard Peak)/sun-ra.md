# Description
Probably the best line here: short, slick, and powerful. Start sitting with right hand on a cool undercling and left just above on the sloping lip. Make a tough move right to a crimpy sidepull, then make a crux move back left to a left hand sidepull. Finish by figuring out the easier but tricky bulge to a hidden jug and the top. The short and low crux on this makes it (I think) either a good first 6 or a tough 5.A potential variation could start matched on the double undercling. This feels pretty beefy but is probably doable.# Location
Back side of parking lot boulder, just right of the big flake.# Protection
Pad or two.
