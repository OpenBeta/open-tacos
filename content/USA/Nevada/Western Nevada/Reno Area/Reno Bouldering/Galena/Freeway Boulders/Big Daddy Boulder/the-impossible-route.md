# Description
This route follows the large ledges up the overhanging face of the Big Daddy Boulder. The beginning 5 feet seem possiblish, but after that I don't know how to make this route work. Thus the name. Maybe some one with more skill can tick this one off.# Location
right up the middle of the overhanging face.# Protection
