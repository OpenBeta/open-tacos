# Description
SDS.  2 boulders meet to form a dihedrial.  It's a rules problem.  Can't use the boulder on the left.  The crux is about half way up.  Don't know why, but it seems like every time someone misses the move they end belly flopping on the mats below..# Location
On the left side of the south face of the boulder# Protection
A couple of pads
