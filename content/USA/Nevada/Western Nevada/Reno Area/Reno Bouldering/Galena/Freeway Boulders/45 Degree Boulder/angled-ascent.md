# Description
Plenty of large angled ledges leading all the way up and over the boulder.# Location
As far left as you can go in the flat area before running into the bushes, sit start on the large shelf and make your up using the chalked up large angled ledges. You're welcome for the chalk marks, good foot work will make this route a breeze.# Protection
