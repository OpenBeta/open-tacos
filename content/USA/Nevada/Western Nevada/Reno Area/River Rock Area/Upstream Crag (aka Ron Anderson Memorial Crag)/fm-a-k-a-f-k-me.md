# Description
A bouldery start leads to a hand crack and then a roof. The roof boasts good hand jams with sparse feet as well as a sloping jug to the left. The OW pod exiting the roof provides a further challenge but deep hand jams are there for those who reach. Otherwise, it's probably Fuck Me city, although some lieback beta might work at the lip....Hero jamming through wide hands in an overhung crack begins after the rest ledge just over the roof. Exit via some jugs to the back set anchors, but watch out for the creaking flake in the crack towards the top!The route will clean up with more traffic but everything that needs to be solid is, and protection is abundant.# Location
The obvious, East facing hand crack with an offwidth pod above a roof in the North gully# Protection
mostly hands up to a 4" Camalot, although larger 5"-6" pieces could be used. Fixe anchors.
