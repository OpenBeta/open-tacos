# Description
The physical crux is right at the first bolt.  The mental crux is getting to the fourth bolt.  Feels really airy.  Don't go straight for the fourth bolt, but head left then up.At the bulge by the fourth bolt, be careful.  Up untill this point the rock is high quality.  It's a little chossy through here, nocked a block off with my foot once. Belayer should be careful.# Location
To the right of all existing climbs at River Rock.  You have to scramble all the way to right of the entire face, then walk back left on the ledge.  Belay from the ledge.# Protection
4 bolts on face, plus 2 bolts at top of route.  Mussy Hook Carabiners for chains.
