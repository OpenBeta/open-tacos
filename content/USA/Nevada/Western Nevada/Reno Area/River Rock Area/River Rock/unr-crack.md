# Description
This is the climb that everybody in Reno learns to lead trad on.  Old shcool 5.7, so if your not used to climbing crack, will feel like hard 5.9.  The crux is the ten foot hand crack about 20' up.  Ultra Classic to the area.# Location
Right when you walk up, this will be the obvious crack right infront of you with somebody on it.# Protection
