# Description
When you come to the base you will see a really thin crack.  This is the start.  You can also do the start of African Flake (to the right, ledge system), but this really takes away from the experience.  Make hard moves up to the horizontal crack.  Continue up.  You will come to a good rest ledge with a bulge above you. Crux time.# Location
Tallest and most prominent crack.  Next climb to the right of Spring Break and to the left of African Flake.# Protection
Gear 3".
