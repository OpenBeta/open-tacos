# Description
Start up a finger crack, using feet to the left to make it easier or sticking to the crack to ratchet the grade up a bit. Then follow the bolt line to the anchor. Crux is off a ledge about halfway up that requires careful studying of high feet, the left arete, and a hidden jug. It's summer school but you still have to pay attention.# Location
On the face just to the right of On Safari arete and left of the Head Case wall. Look for the finger crack just left of an old aid line (rivet ladder).# Protection
1-2 pieces of finger/thin hand size gear for the start, then 4 bolts. 2 bolt anchor with rings.
