# Description
Start up some slopers to a hard mantle move.  Make a balancy move to some crimpers to the right of the arete and then finish up on a broken crack.  Not to much protection, much better as a top rope.  You can walk around to the left and scramble up some 4th class to top rope.# Location
When you first walk up, UNR crack will be right infront of your face.  This climb is to the left and is on the arete.# Protection
