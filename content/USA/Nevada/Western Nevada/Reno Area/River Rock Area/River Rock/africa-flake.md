# Description
WARNING: This is the old rating before the Africa Flake broke off... Alot harder now and height dependent.That being said, can be a really fun climb. The crux now is getting to the first bolt without the flake. If you are under 5'11", you might want to start on Karls crack, put a few pieces in, and traverse right over to the second bolt. Make some good, slight overhanging moves. Get to good ledge and traverse right. Make hard unprotected moves up crack (Bring Trad). Finish on chains.# Location
Just to the right of Karls crack.# Protection
Gear to 2", 4 bolts.
