# Description
At first ledge, slot blue tcu (bad) or nut and make balancy move.  Next crux is the last crack seem before the crack ends.  Then head right and up final seem to ledge on Carl's.# Location
This climb starts just to the left of carl's crack.  Start right next to the tree trunk and head up. The branches from the tree will get in your face towards the top.# Protection
Poor protection.  Bring small cams and small nuts.  there is a solid slot right before the final crux seem that is good for a blue or yellow tcu. If you fall before here, could be dicey.
