# Description
Start in the jumbled boulders at the base of the wall at two parallel cracks under a roof. Follow cracks and generous face features to the left corner of the roof, move left and pull onto the face. Follow a fissure/crack up and into patina right of a large dihedral system. Continue up face features to a two bolt anchor. Rappel 35M to the ground.There are truckloads of routes to be done in the Wild Granites, and this route will certainly go to the top of the buttress and link to the formations above and behind it. We simply ran out of time. We intend to return for more new routes!# Location
At 39.044758, -117.165431 take a dirt road and make your way to "Indian Burial Grd Road". Do NOT take the road that goes to the residence/ranch on the hillside north of McLeod Creek. Make your way west toward the base of the mountain and park at 39.062016, -117.201551. Hike up the drainage about a half mile, then slowly trend up the hillside toward the towers. Plan on a healthy, spirited hike. The approach is only a couple clicks south of epic.Below and left of the largest formations is a dominant gully/spillway with three distinct black water streaks below a cedar forest. Right of this gully/spillway is a series of three buttresses; a smaller buttress on the lower left adjacent to the gully spoken of, a much larger buttress higher in the back, and Triple T is the third buttress on the right.The pictures show the route best, and in the absence of any developed trails, or really being able to determine where the other names walls are located, I'll leave it to the pictures to show the way best.# Protection
Medium gear to a couple of bolts and bolted rappel anchors
