# Description
10a face climbing up to the right facing corner. From the top of the corner cop a rest and bust out the crux stem sequence. Thin and technical stemming eases off to a heartbreaker before the chains# Location
The huge right facing corner that can be seen on the right side of Mineral Wall from the start of La Roca Mas Fina# Protection
I believe it has 6-8 bolts and bring a few finger sized pieces to protect the crack leading up to the corner
