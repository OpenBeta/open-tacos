# Description
Easily the best route we did, this is a classic. Get on it!P1) Follow a crack left of the roof to a belay below the roof, 5.10-P2) Horizontal roof crack to a belay at a stance right of the sccop. 5.10+P3) Climb a short ways up the crack before diagonaling up and left on a slab and thin crack to a belay in a seam below bolts leading up to a roof, 5.11/+ (This pitch can be combined with pitch 2)P4) The route's crux. Follow the bolts across the slab through a roof then up and left around a techy slab. As the crack starts to pinch down pull left into a gorgeous left-facing corner, 5.12-P5) More left-facing corner requiring 3D slab moves, finishing up and right, 5.11/+P6) Take it to the shoulder below the summit block proper on a slab next to crack, 5.7More spray here if needed:seanmclane.com/30-fa-projecâ€¦# Location
