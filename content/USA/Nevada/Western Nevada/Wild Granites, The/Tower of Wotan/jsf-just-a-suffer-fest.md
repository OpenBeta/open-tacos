# Description
This is was climbed as an access route to the top of the Tower of Wotan. It is probably the easiest way to that summit.P1) From the bottom of the large chimney, climb blocky terrain to reach the first large ledge. Carefully pull down on the Wheat-Thin-like flake system on the face above. Traverse right around the corner and belay on a sloping ledge. 5.10c PG13P2) Downclimb around left past a tree and up a left-facing corner, then cut hard back right past the “falcon cave”. Traverse around 50 feet in total and end up under a flaring thin hands crack. 5.9P3) Follow the crack into a left-facing corner where the crack flares and seams out. At the top, traverse right through the notch and climb unprotected 5.4 face to the tower’s summit. Rap from here off the opposite side (tat on bolts goes over the edge). 5.10d# Location
