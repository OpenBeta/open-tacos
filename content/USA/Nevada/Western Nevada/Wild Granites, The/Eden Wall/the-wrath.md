# Description
P1/2) This mega 80m pitch starts in a left-leaning groove just left of the end of the chimney on the far right side of Eden Wall. Exit the groove right at a bolt following thin cracks to a layback. Splitter big hands take you to the chimney flare and a bolted station at the base of the corner. 80m 5.11bP3) Stem and layback your way up the corner on small gear to a bolted anchor. 25m 5.11+P4) Layback and undercling out a roof. Turn the lip with huge exposure into a layback against a 6-inch foot rail. Take care to keep the rope out of the crack at the lip (there is gear to do this). Gun it up the amazing crack to a large ledge and rap station. 40m 5.12a# Location
