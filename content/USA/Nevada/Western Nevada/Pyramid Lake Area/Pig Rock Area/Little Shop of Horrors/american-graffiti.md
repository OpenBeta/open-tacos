# Description
Follows the beginning flake section on Ton-Ton before branching left into two distinct boulder problems with a rest in-between. The first boulder problem is fairly straight forward on small edges (V6) while the second boulder is very distinct and powerful. Revolving around a brutal gaston or undercling (V9). The upper section is pumpy and sustained with a final throw at the end to a continuously degrading sloper.# Location
Shares the same starting bolts as Ton Ton before branching left up the steep headwall.# Protection
6 bolts.
