# Description
Classic of the area, low start, 2 hands on side pull. Work your way straight up through sharp crimps. Big moves are needed, explosive precision.# Location
Far side of the whole thing, over hanging wall with small spire behind it.# Protection
We used 2 pads but would have preferred 1 or 2 more for peace of mind.
