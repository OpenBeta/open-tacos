# Description
Start on the same start holds as Lizard King, head to the left until a chunk sticks out in a straight wall, quite a few feet over. Then go up that for the top out. Personal preference is to go through the top middle, but can also take the low route.# Location
Same start as Lizard king then go to the left. Aka, right side around corner side pull and low left side pocket or crimp.# Protection
2 pads needed or one great spotter to keep moving 1.
