# Description
Start low on the left side of the undercling/sidepull. Work your way along the underclings and follow the line towards the top out.Crux is from the undercling to the top out. Finish with an easy mantle.This rock is good quality, but still needs to be climbed on and minimal cleaning before it becomes excellent.# Location
60 meters to the east from the road.# Protection
One pad and one spotter on the crux move. A dull knife edge at the base of the crux can ruin a climber's day.
