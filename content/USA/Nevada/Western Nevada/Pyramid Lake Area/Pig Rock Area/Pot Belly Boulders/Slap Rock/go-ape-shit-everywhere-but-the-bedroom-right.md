# Description
Located in the obvious seam left of Belly of the Beast.Start with a right hand in a sloper sidepull and your left hand on a high pinch. Use high feet to reach a jug and escape right over the Belly. Same finish as Belly as the Beast.Although the wall is featured, the slight overhang will spit off climbers that don't respect the route. Good feet and continuous core tension will give climbers this checkmark.# Location
Northeast of the small parking area for the boulders. Approach is about 60 seconds.# Protection
One pad. One spotter.
