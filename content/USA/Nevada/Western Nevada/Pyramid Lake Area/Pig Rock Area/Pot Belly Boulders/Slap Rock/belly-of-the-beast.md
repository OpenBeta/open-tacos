# Description
Start high on the underside of the belly on a left two finger slope-y crimp and a right hand on a high crimp pinch. Work your way up through slopers and pockets to a jug rail at the top.Most climbers should match on the rail, drop off, give a high five to their spotter and call it good. Ballsy climbers can top out to the right over the crumbling beach.The top out needs some major cleaning -- as in a bulldozer and about a hundred day laborers to clean off the top. But a topout is possible to the right.# Location
This beautiful line is on the right side of Slap Rock on the obvious belly-looking feature.# Protection
One pad. One spotter.
