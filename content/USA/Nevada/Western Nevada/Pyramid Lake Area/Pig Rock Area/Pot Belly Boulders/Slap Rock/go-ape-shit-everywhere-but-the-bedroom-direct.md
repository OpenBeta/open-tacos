# Description
Located in the obvious seam left of Belly of the Beast.Start with a right hand in a sloper sidepull and your left hand on a high pinch. Use high feet to reach a jug and continue up the seam and right side of the face to the high topout.Although the wall is featured, the slight overhang will spit off climbers that don't respect the route. Good feet and continuous core tension will give climbers this checkmark.Avoid holds in the light brown rock to the left of the seam, especially higher on the route. It's loose and rotten and will result in beastily breaking off holds and falling.# Location
Northeast of the parking area for the Pot Belly Boulders. Approach is about 60 seconds.# Protection
One pad. One spotter.
