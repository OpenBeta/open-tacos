# Description
This climb is a nice easy highball boulder problem. This piece of rock is one of the only boulder problems in the area where you will not find one piece of choss or any sketchy holds. The only problem is, the fall is bad.Start at the base of the rock and use the seams on both the left and ride side of the rock. Some choose to lieback the entire route, but it is much easier to use both seams and stem your feet on both corners.Execute and repeat these steps about 10 times and before you know it, you'll be at the top.Although the route is about 25 feet tall and there is no real place to put a crash pad, you should keep your wits about you. But before you know it, you'll be done and wanting more when you top this out.# Location
Just behind Neoplastic on the left side of the boulder field. Find your way behind Neoplastic and find the slide. Walkoff on the backside of the route.# Protection
Bibles. Buddha. Gonads. Whatever else will keep your head in the game.The base of the low-angle slab is steep, so a pad will not do any good for falling climbers.
