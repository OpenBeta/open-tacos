# Description
I'm sure a lot of people know more about these routes than I do, but I wanted to put one up so people know the type of options there are out here for an easy relaxing winter day, especially if you aren't man enough to climb at little shop of horrors around the corner.This route is below the only intact 2 bolt anchor I could find at the top of the pig. There are probably at least 5 distinct variations you could climb off of this anchor. We did 4. They are all fairly similar grade. Felt like 5.7 slab climbing for the most part, with a move or two that might be approaching 5.8.There's a few cool pockets and some decent little ledges. Some of the rock isn't very sturdy, i wouldn't want to lead it, but fine for messing around on top rope.There is an old bolt line for a sport route a bit to the right where all the bolts have been chopped. Not sure what the history is out here, but it is probably long and varied.# Location
We used the directions from MP and got out here fairly easily and drove all the way to the bottom of the rock. Road seems pretty reasonable. Probably could have done it in the Subaru.# Protection
2 bolt anchor. no chains or rap rings
