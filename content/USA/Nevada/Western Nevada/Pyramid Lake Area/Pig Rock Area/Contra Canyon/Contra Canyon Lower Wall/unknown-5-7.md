# Description
To the right of In-coming Scud (i.e., the blank 5.11b up the pocketed face). This climb goes up a shallow corner/crack system and has four intact bolts.This climb is harder than 5.7, maybe 5.9? Something must have broken off because following the bolt line requires some weird body-English moves. Fun and well protected.From the top of this climb, In-coming Scud can be easily top roped, which is nice since In-coming Scud is missing all of its hangers.# Location
Shallow corner/crack system to the right of In-coming Scud (i.e., the blank 5.11b up the pocketed face).# Protection
4 bolts and two bolt anchor at the top.
