# Description
Pocketed climb following the easiest line up. The first moves by the first bolt are harder than 5.4 (5.6?) but it's well protected. The top is pretty crumbly.# Location
Furthest climb to the right. Start up a pocketed shallow right-facing corner.# Protection
I believe it's four bolts and two bolt anchor at the top.All bolts and hangers are intact.
