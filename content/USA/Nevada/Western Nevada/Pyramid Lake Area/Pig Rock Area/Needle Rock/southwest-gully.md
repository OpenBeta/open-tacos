# Description
This is an alternate route to the easier West Gully. Follow up an obvious corner/gullly to a ledge. We went left off the ledge through some more ledges, mantles, a little bit of face climbing, and you're at the top. You could probably go straight up from the ledge but it was harder (5.10?) with a death block waiting to fall from the top.Cruz is only 8 feet off the ground, getting through a weird stemming spot with terrible rock. Oh wait, all the rock is pretty terrible.# Location
About 30-40 yards around the corner to the right from the descent/West Gully route.# Protection
