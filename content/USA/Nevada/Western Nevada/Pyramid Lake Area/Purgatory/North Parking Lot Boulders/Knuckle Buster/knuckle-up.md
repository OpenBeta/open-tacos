# Description
Sit start low on the flake traverse right and then dyno straight up to the sharp jug. The arete is off/a different problem. Sharpness might warrant a two star rating, but I thought it was a great line regardless.# Location
Left side of the right most block. Problem starts on the chalked up flake.# Protection
1-2 pads
