        <p className='text-xl text-slate-700'>
          OpenBeta is not backed by venture capitalists, nor it is supported by ads.
          Fortunately there is a small and active group of volunteers donating their time and expertise to keep the project running and develop it further.
        </p>
        <p className='text-xl text-slate-700'>
          For the project to survive and continue to evolve, we need your financial support and ask for your donation today.
          All money donated will go directly to fund OpenBeta infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p className='text-xl text-slate-700'>
          You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3/month.  <strong><a className='underline' href='https://opencollective.com/openbeta'>Donate today</a>!</strong>
