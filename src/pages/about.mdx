# Welcome!

OpenBeta is a grassroots initiative where climbers coming together with a common goal to keep climbing information free and accessible.
 We are building a new open collaboration platform for sharing climbing routes (project codename: open-tacos).


To make things easier to manage, we split the project into two distinct parts:
- Climb route content:  ([GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBeta/opentacos-content))
- Cource code ([GitHub](https://github.com/openbeta/open-tacos))
