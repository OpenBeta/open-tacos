# Welcome! üëã

OpenBeta is a grassroots initiative that brings climbers together for one common goal ‚Äî to keep rock climbing information free and open for everyone.

## Why an open platform?
OpenBeta platform is a new avenue for climbers to share and receive free climbing beta.  We set up the project as a nonprofit foundation so that it would always serve the climbing community, rather than investors and shareholders.

We pledge to keep climbers' generous contribution free and open, and without legal restrictions [preventing people from using the information](https://www.climbing.com/news/mountain-project-openbeta-and-the-fight-over-climbing-data-access/) in creative and productive ways.

## Project structure

To make things easier to manage, the platform (codename: open-tacos) is split into two distinct parts:
- **Climbing content**:  GPS coordinates, grade, photos, description aka "Beta" for routes and areas.  ([GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBeta/opentacos-content))
- **Source code**: HTML, Javascript code, icons, buttons, etc. ([GitHub](https://github.com/openbeta/open-tacos))

When combing the two parts together, poof! we have this complete website you're currently looking at.
The separation allows different teams of volunteers to work independently which is similar to running an online publication ‚Äì writers can focus on producing and improving the content, while web developers and designers can work on the visual representation. 

# How to contribute

We want contributing to the project be fun and educational.  All contributions are welcome, including new routes, blog posts, bug fixes, and more.

## Not sure how to start contributing?

No worries, you can ask questions on the community [message board](https://community.openbeta.io) or on [OpenBeta Discord](https://discord.gg/w2KpQu2ca5) chat server.

## To see what we're working on

Check out our public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Ir8emiyR/openbeta-project)

## How to submit an edit

We host this project on GitHub.com, a popular source code hosting platform.
Information for each climbing route and area is stored in a human-readable text file.
We purposely avoid complex database techonology, instead rely on many existing features of GitHub to help us keep track of user edits.  Climbers can join an area admin group to help us review and approve changes.

A sample route description file:

```
---
route_name: Chain Reaction
type:
  sport: true
yds: 5.12c
fa: Alan Watts
---

# Description
One of the most photogenic routes at Smith Rock.

# Protection
Quickdraws
```

This file format is commonly known as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
Metadata for the climb or the area is placed in the *front matter* section sandwiched between two --- lines.

> Note: For now, you need to create an account on GitHub.com to add new routes/areas or edit existing ones.  We are working on simplifying the process in the near future.

## How to contribute code

We're looking for help with User experience design, web development (CSS/React/Node.js), and data science (Python/Pandas).

OpenBeta is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
