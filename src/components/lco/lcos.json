SCC members and volunteers are climbers from Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Arkansas and elsewhere who have joined forces to preserve access to climbing areas in the region. The SCC raises money to purchase or lease climbing areas from private landowners. The SCC is a local grass-roots organization dedicated to preserving climbing areas in the South. The SCC works hand in hand with other climbing advocacy groups like the Access Fund, as well as public and private landowners such as state and national parks, other land trusts, private businesses and local families. Without SCC, many of the climbing areas you enjoy today would not be available for public use. Your financial contribution, however big or small, helps sustain the work of the SCC. SCC preserves climbing areas for current and future generations in the Southeast. We do this through acquisition, stewardship, and community, so that all climbers can enjoy equitable access to the outdoors. We believe all people should have the opportunity to explore the vast natural landscapes in our region. We do not discriminate based on race, color, gender, ethnicity, ability, sexual orientation, or any other identity and we will not tolerate prejudice on our properties or within our organization. We believe the outdoors is for all people to enjoy without fear of discrimination and we will continue to work to ensure public protected climbing areas exist in perpetuity.",

        "bio": "The Central Arizona Bolt Replacement Program (CABRP) is an accredited 501(c)(3) organization. It was created to preserve the safety and integrity of fixed protection throughout central Arizona. Since its creation, the CABRP has replaced hundreds of worn and aged lead bolts and anchors. The fixed anchors used to create most of the sport climbs in the US are made of non-stainless steel. As such, they are subject to corrosion that weakens the anchors holding power. The non-stainless steel bolts throughout central Arizona have been exposed to environmental factors since the first day they were placed. All told, there are approximately 2,755 total routes throughout central Arizona. Working with the American Safe Climbing Association (ASCA), CABRP is placing stainless steel glue-in bolts and stainless steel expansion anchors specifically designed for the rigors of our sport. CABRP requests that all climbers establishing new routes use modern, stainless steel equipment. CABRP recognizes that this makes establishing a new route more expensive, but it is also the responsible way to protect future climbers and the precious resource that is our rock walls.

In the late 1980s, the placement of bolts became a topic of controversy in the Boulder area. During that time, Boulder Mountain Parks and City and County Open Space prohibited the placement of new bolts. These actions substantially changed certain climbs and enraged many local climbers. As a result of this well-meant, but misdirected effort, some of the new bolts were chopped. Bob Toll approached several active local climbers and informed them that the Park was willing to work with the climbing community on these issues. The Park\u2019s position was that Eldorado belonged to all climbers and that individuals could no longer be permitted to take unilateral actions that affected all climbers without community input. ACE designed the fixed hardware review process, which provides the climbing community with the opportunity to approve or disapprove of proposals to establish new routes requiring fixed gear and to change existing climbing routes. ACE\u2019s role is to advise the Park as to the opinion of the local climbing community; the final decision on whether to approve the proposal rests with the Park. To obtain maximum feedback and support from the climbing community, the ACE Board of Directors is comprised of representatives from the Access Fund, the American Alpine Club, the American Mountain Guides Association, and the Colorado Mountain Club, as well as unaffiliated members drawn from the climbing community. ACE is a non-profit organization dedicated to representing climbers\u2019 interests in Eldorado Canyon State Park and preserving the opportunity to climb and the diversity of the climbing experience in Eldorado. ACE supports conserving the natural resources and promoting responsible recreational use and land management in ECSP.",

As a result, new route development in the \nFlatirons came to a standstill, and climbers felt disenfranchised from a\n beloved climbing venue.\nIn 1997, a group of climber/activists began brainstorming meetings to determine how best to address this impasse.\n To address the concerns of OSMP regarding the impacts climbers have in \nthe Flatirons, this group set out to demonstrate that climbers are not \njust users of the Flatirons, but also stewards. Sponsoring trail and \nrestoration projects, educational outreach efforts, and attending \nnumerous OSMP sponsored community gatherings, these climber/activists \n(eventually incorporated as the Flatirons Climbing Council [FCC]) slowly\n but surely built a relationship with OSMP based upon trust and open \ncommunication.",

        "bio": "Over the course of the last year, we have been involved in working with dedication to keep our community talking and trying to find resolve related to opinions and perspective on climbing Pikes Peak. Our first steps were taken in 2020 to try and find a solution from having members talking openly with the PPCA present and attempting to work through stances together. Earlier this summer, we released a public survey on how our region's climbers feel traveling on Pikes Peak\u2019s granite should be upheld. We are happy to share the results of our survey asking what YOU the community wants and feels is appropriate to work towards for years to come with Pikes Peak climbing. 93.8% of survey takers felt it appropriate to have experienced placement of planned fixed protection on Pikes Peak. 95.2% of survey takers felt that fixed anchors should be present on routes that hold no areas for placement of gear or that do not provide safe paths for exit. There is a lot more feedback we have documented from the survey that we will be opening up to discussion, and we thank you so much for giving us your perspective on Pikes Peak! This information helps the PPCA in moving forward with conversations with the Pikes Peak Forest District for a Climbing Management Plan similar to how climbing is overseen in South Platte Forest District with the PPCA. Funding for this project will be provided from the Jim DiNapoli legacy donation that was given to the Pikes Peak Climbers Alliance, Mountain Chalet & Springs Climbing Center. As well, an attempt has been made to contact closely involved members of the community about this decision prior to this public statement out of respect & consideration. Pikes Peak IS 'America's Mountain', and not just our local climbing communities private crag. We all owe it to these mountains to give our full respect in exchange for the wonderful opportunity to cross through its doors.",

        "bio": "This was the description of Rifle written by the late Darek Krol. I have left the grammar and word choice for your enjoyment: Most climbs are above 5.11d and the grading is generally stiff. If routes feel hard at first, don\u2019t worry, it usually gets better once you get used to the style of climbing here. Most people are enchanted by canyon\u2019s beauty on first contact but on closer inspection, cliffs look more like a \u201cchoss pile\u201d. Most routes here needed some cleaning from loose rocks, a few even needed some interventions with sica, so, true, the rock may be not the best in the world but most routes are excellent, offering unique climbing style and incomparable movement. Full body tension, compression hugs, sloppy pinches, precise footwork on smears, mastery in art of knee-barring, insane pump on jugs on big overhangs, cryptic sequences \u2013 characterize best climbing here. Tidious projecting is part of the canyon as much as Rifle creek. Each sector has its own, easy to find, access trail. Climbers needing absolutly park close to their current warm-ups or projects will start very early and take parking pole positions. Most climbers start their days at North end around Meat Wall, Ruckman Cave and Project Wall or lower at Wasteland. We encourage people to bring and use bikes in the canyon.\u201d This website is not a guide to Rifle Canyon. We encourage you to buy an appropriate guidebook or to download a corresponding mobile app where you will find all detailed information.",

Personal responsibility, self sufficiency and environmental stewardship are core values, as well as preserving each citizen\u2019s right to their \u201cFreedom of the Hills.\u201d Originally conceived as an avalanche-education organization in 1986, the Telluride Mountain Club (TMtC) evolved towards access advocacy and promoting responsible, safe backcountry travel and recreation. He is an avid rock climber of 28 years who established first ascents in Colorado, Utah, California and Alaska. He is the only attorney to have studied the impact that the Town of Telluride\u2019s condemnation of the Valley Floor for open space and recreation will have on land-use planning in the Rocky Mountains. When not busy with work and the club, Tor loves hanging out with his wife Sharon and son Wilder at their home in Ilium. Todd got distracted from a career in Academics in the early 90\u2019s when the siren songs of the Andes and the Alaska Range coincided with a break in his graduate program in Linguistics and Anthropology and he\u2019s been a mountain guide ever since. Todd feel incredibly fortunate, as the recent years have provided him the opportunity to get out and lead trips, but also to spend more time with his family. While the quest for finding balance in life between work and family will probably always be elusive, both are tons of fun, especially in our neck of the woods! Ximena values creating and maintaining access to the outdoors with a special emphasis on equity, sustainability, and preservation. Her motivation to help Telluride\u2019s outdoor-recreation community is most certainly correlated with her desire to explore the San Juan Mountains on her days off with her husband Matt and their dog Annie Oakley. He transferred this experience into becoming a professional in the industry working with IMBA Trail Solutions and contracting with Swiss based Allegra Tourismus.

The SCC raises money to purchase or lease climbing areas from private landowners. The SCC is a local grass-roots organization dedicated to preserving climbing areas in the South. The SCC works hand in hand with other climbing advocacy groups like the Access Fund, as well as public and private landowners such as state and national parks, other land trusts, private businesses and local families. Without SCC, many of the climbing areas you enjoy today would not be available for public use. Your financial contribution, however big or small, helps sustain the work of the SCC. SCC preserves climbing areas for current and future generations in the Southeast. We do this through acquisition, stewardship, and community, so that all climbers can enjoy equitable access to the outdoors. We believe all people should have the opportunity to explore the vast natural landscapes in our region. We do not discriminate based on race, color, gender, ethnicity, ability, sexual orientation, or any other identity and we will not tolerate prejudice on our properties or within our organization.

Drew Northup; CC BY-NC-SA https://goo.gl/photos/otCLrrWhf1vSH76S9 A group of Maine climbers met in October of 2013 in response to the unfortunate and untimely passing of Don Nelligan. Don, a well-known rock climber, was the proud owner and protector of Eagle Bluff, the crown jewel of Maine climbing destinations, for almost 20 years. Don's tragic death was sorrowful for many of Maine's climbing legends, who spent much of the 1980's and 1990's establishing and developing the Crags of Clifton, Acadia, and Katahdin. Consequently, the Clifton Climbers Alliance formed with the objective of preserving and protecting Eagle Bluff \u2014 ensuring open rock climbing and recreational access into the future. Given a nine-month window, the CCA partnered with the Access Fund and was put to task with raising $150,000.00 to purchase Eagle Bluff. Thanks to the generous donations of many supporters \u2014 including the Quimby Family Foundation, Land for Maine's Future, and The Davis Conservation Foundation \u2014 the CCA was successful in its objective. On August 26, 2014 the Clifton Climbers Alliance closed on the sale and became owners, stewards and caretakers of Eagle Bluff. Today, the Clifton Climbers Alliance is focused on maintaining Eagle Bluff as Maine's premier climbing destination. However, as an organization, the CCA recognizes how important it is that none of our climbing resources come under this type of threat again. It is with this in mind that the CCA looks for opportunities to improve landowner relations, protect access, and secure succession plans for other crags throughout Central Maine. The Clifton Climbers Alliance is a federally recognized non-profit based near Bangor, Maine.All donations are tax deductible to the fullest extent of the law.",

        "bio": "The Carolina Climber's Coalition was established January 16, 1995 with the purposes of preserving the natural environment, promoting safe climbing practices and preserving climber's access to climbing areas in North and South Carolina. 'The Coalition was created as a result of a rumor that spread throughout North Carolina in 1994 that NC State Parks would close climbing access. In January 1995 almost 100 area climbers voted unanimously to create the coalition to help preserve climbing access in the Carolinas.' In 2005 Sean Cobourn, then president, and Jon Myers got wind of the opportunity to purchase one of the largest cliffs in the Southeast, Laurel Knob. With overwhelming community and industry support, the CCC made an offer to purchase the cliff. The purchase of Laurel Knob transformed the the CCC from grassroots organization to landowners, land managers and advocates. This change allows us to be part of a growing movement of organizations that are truly preserving and expanding your climbing opportunities. We continue to work with local, state and federal organizations to help preserve and protect our climbing privileges. Area representatives serve as liasons between the board, climbers and land managers. We host an annual public meetings in the Fall / Winter of each year, usually the Friday night before the Hound Ears bouldering competition.

We are a community of climbers with a common goal rooted in preserving the Northeast's premier sport climbing destination, located on Rattlesnake Mountain in Rumney, New Hampshire. \u200b The RCA was formed when public access to Rumney Rocks was threatened in the early '90s. After raising funds from area climbers and the Access Fund, the RCA purchased the privately owned land which held cliffs that include the Meadows, 5.8 Crag, and Monsters From The Id. RCA activists then sold the land, at a monetary loss, to the United States Forest Service. \u200b In 2016, the RCA again joined forces with the Access Fund and purchased The Final Frontier. This 86-acre tract includes Rumney's northwest crags: The Prudential, Buffalo Pit, Buffalo Corral, Northwest Territories, Asylum, Very Nice Crack area, Boundary Rock, and part of the Blackjack Boulders. In Feb. 2020, the RCA transferred Final Frontier ownership to the USFS. These areas are open to public access as a result of the RCA's work. \u200b The RCA is continuing to work with the USFS, the Access Fund, and the AAC to pursue a common goal of preserving and improving rock climbing in Rumney, NH. \u200b Anyone who chooses to climb or hike on RCA land is solely responsible for his or her own safety. Climbing, mountaineering, and hiking are inherently dangerous activities regardless of your skill level or experience.",

Current Volunteer Organizers: Dave Schappe Tom Scales In the spring of 1991 the owner of the land, Michael Rosenbaum, closed the area to rock climbers based on concerns about liability and repeated vandalism. The vandalism had cost him several thousand dollars, and he had attributed the damage to climbers. After discussions with the members of the Portland rock climbing community, Mr. Rosenbaum agreed to permit rock climbing access to the Carver Bridge Cliff for members of the Carver Climbing Club if three conditions continue to be satisfied: That vandalism, littering, and other trashing of the property not occur. That each member sign a written release affirming the she or he assumes all risks to his or her personal safety while climbing and will not sue Mr. Rosenbaum and/or family should an accident occur. That climbing activities not infringe upon the privacy of the Rosenbaum family in their house on top of the cliff. Early leaders like Gary Rall and Laura Potter used their skills in organization and law to establish the Carver Climbing Club, and the club was founded with three primary goals: Provide an organizational link between Mr. Rosenbaum and the rock climbing community. Act as a point of contact for Mr. Rosenbaum and local rock climbers. Members of the Carver Climbing Club are charged with acting within and supporting the spirit of the agreement in which Mr. Rosenbaum granted club members access to the area for rock climbing. This includes two parts: That members discipline their own actions by not littering, protecting signs and survey markers, and respecting the Rosenbaum family's privacy. The Stone Cliff Inn Restaurant and Bar officially opened in 2004, and visitors have been drawn to the wooded areas surrounding the restaurant since the Carver boulders gained notoriety in the 2008 film Twilight. The Carver Climbing Club remains the primary point of contact for Mr. Rosenbaum as issues arise.",

        "bio": "SWPACC was officially established on December 1, 2014 after local climbers and friends recognized the need for such an organization in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The first action was taken in 2015 when SWPACC coordinated with other Pennsylvania local climbing organizations, the Access Fund, and numerous other user groups (hikers, runners, etc.) to express support for keeping State Gamelands open to non-hunters year round, in response to a proposal for significant closures. Throughout the next few years, SWPACC took part in various climbing area revitalization projects including graffiti removal, hardware replacement, and trail cleanups. PAST President Having climbed extensively in SWPA, Joel enjoys snaking any projects that the real developers of new areas just didn\u2019t get around to yet. VICE PRESIDENT Jennifer began her climbing journey in 2016 with a barn, a group of friends, and a lot of plywood. A former biologist, teacher of Deaf and hard-of-hearing students, and environmentalist, Jennifer also serves as the Environmental Chair for the Explorers Club of Pittsburgh. An intense hobby fostered by being a gym rat, local clubs, adventurous trips, and close mentors ultimately led to a shared dream of opening ASCEND Climbing, as well as being a founding board member of SWPACC. Paul also spends his free time running, practicing yoga, loving his quirky cat, and traveling to experience live music with his hilarious wife and fun-loving friends. He was the driving force behind the revitalization of The Lost Crag, and over the years, he has rallied scores of climbers throughout the tri-state to become more dedicated stewards of our local climbing resources. As the founder of The Pittsburgh Public Schools Climbing Club in the mid-90s, Mike has partnered with stakeholders in the community to expose countless city kids to an activity from which they have traditionally been excluded. The experiences of feeling the rock beneath her fingertips, the dance-like movement of ascending the route, and the occasional Type 2 fun keep her coming back for more.",

        "bio": "The Carolina Climber's Coalition was established January 16, 1995 with the purposes of preserving the natural environment, promoting safe climbing practices and preserving climber's access to climbing areas in North and South Carolina. 'The Coalition was created as a result of a rumor that spread throughout North Carolina in 1994 that NC State Parks would close climbing access. In January 1995 almost 100 area climbers voted unanimously to create the coalition to help preserve climbing access in the Carolinas.' In 2005 Sean Cobourn, then president, and Jon Myers got wind of the opportunity to purchase one of the largest cliffs in the Southeast, Laurel Knob. With overwhelming community and industry support, the CCC made an offer to purchase the cliff. The purchase of Laurel Knob transformed the the CCC from grassroots organization to landowners, land managers and advocates. This change allows us to be part of a growing movement of organizations that are truly preserving and expanding your climbing opportunities. We continue to work with local, state and federal organizations to help preserve and protect our climbing privileges. Area representatives serve as liasons between the board, climbers and land managers. We host an annual public meetings in the Fall / Winter of each year, usually the Friday night before the Hound Ears bouldering competition.

SCC members and volunteers are climbers from Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Arkansas and elsewhere who have joined forces to preserve access to climbing areas in the region. The SCC raises money to purchase or lease climbing areas from private landowners. The SCC is a local grass-roots organization dedicated to preserving climbing areas in the South. The SCC works hand in hand with other climbing advocacy groups like the Access Fund, as well as public and private landowners such as state and national parks, other land trusts, private businesses and local families. Without SCC, many of the climbing areas you enjoy today would not be available for public use. Your financial contribution, however big or small, helps sustain the work of the SCC. SCC preserves climbing areas for current and future generations in the Southeast. We do this through acquisition, stewardship, and community, so that all climbers can enjoy equitable access to the outdoors. We believe all people should have the opportunity to explore the vast natural landscapes in our region. We do not discriminate based on race, color, gender, ethnicity, ability, sexual orientation, or any other identity and we will not tolerate prejudice on our properties or within our organization. We believe the outdoors is for all people to enjoy without fear of discrimination and we will continue to work to ensure public protected climbing areas exist in perpetuity.",

All proceeds benefit Enchanted Rock State Natural Area. The 29th Granite Gripper was held on December 11, 2021 and it was a huge success. We set records for number of registered climbers (150) and money raised for Friends of Enchanted Rock ($10,016)! The link to the results file for the 2019 Gripper is at the bottom of this page. The CTCC members for the period of June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2022 are Bill Horton, Randy Judycki, Matt Markell, and John Myrick. Posted June 10, 2017 After many years of editing and waiting by the CTCC, Texas Parks & Wildlife has approved the Enchanted Rock State Natural Area Climbing Management Plan (CMP). This plan is the product of Texas State Parks staff and the Central Texas Climbing Committee through a Memorandum of Understanding, in place since 1993. The primary goal of this plan is to document policies, procedures and guidelines that have historically been applied to managing climbing activities at Enchanted Rock and to create a framework that allows equitable and sustainable use of the resource. Four files can be downloaded from the bottom of this page: - PDF of the full CMP - PDF of the Fixed Protection Application Form (Appendix B of CMP) - PDF of the Retro Application Public Input Form (Appendix C of CMP) - PDF of the Historic Route Application Form (Appendix E of CMP) The main effect of the approval of this CMP is that it lifts the moratorium on placement of new hardware. The form 'Application for Placement of Fixed Protection' in Appendix B (Section 12) is to be submitted by anyone wishing to create a new bolted route, retrobolt an existing route, or remove existing hardware.

An open forum discussion highlighted the communities support of creating a coalition, and in 2019 the Zion Climbing Coalition was formed. Shortly thereafter, the ZCC partnered with the Southern Utah Climbers Alliance as a local chapter and the Access Fund as a local climbing organization (LCO). Mission The Zion Climbing Coalition seeks to preserve climbing access and promotes a healthy relationship between Zion National Park and surrounding climbing areas for the climbing community through stewardship, inclusivity, education and collaboration.

Individuals responsible for the removal and installation of fixed anchors, other then Standards of Practice board members, will be expected to show an acceptable level of ability and understanding before the BCC will sponsor their work. This evaluation will be made by current Standards Of Practice Board members and will require a majority approval. He was there, intending to replace rusted anchor bolts with stainless steel hardware, but slipped on wet moss and mud and fell before he got his equipment out. Hundreds of Spokane\u2019s rock climbs are protected by badly corroded anchor bolts, many of them over 30 years old.",

Since then, she has travelled extensively - both internationally as well as domestically - looking for the most aesthetic lines, the funnest movements, the best crag snacks, and the best and most welcoming community. During her travels, she arrived in Lander in 2021 psyched on the ease of access to the outdoors and the countless quality limestone lines all within a short drive. Libby is a manager at Wild Iris Mountain Sports and enjoys spending time with her husband, dogs, and new baby in the great Wyoming outdoors. He soon began instructing rock climbing and mountaineering for NOLS--using Lander as his home base while he traveled around the west when not working. When he\u2019s not in the office, Scott can be found climbing, biking, and trail running in the Lander foothills with his faithful four-legged companion Henry, a/k/a Dr. Jowls. He also enjoys walking random bands of limestone in search of new route development opportunities and growing things in his garden Becca grew up in rural Kentucky and first came to Lander in 2010. Her and her husband, Kyle, own Wind River Climbing Guides, offering instructional trips for new and experienced climbers out of Lander. Brian is a Wyoming native that grew up hiking, camping and climbing in the Wind River mountains with his father and brother. The excellent access to numerous sport crags, and close vicinity to the Wind River Range, provides Zach with a lifetime of recreation within a few hours of town. Her favorite place on the planet is on the back porch of the cabin at Pass Creek - telling and listening to stories with her children and watching the last light on the North Country.
